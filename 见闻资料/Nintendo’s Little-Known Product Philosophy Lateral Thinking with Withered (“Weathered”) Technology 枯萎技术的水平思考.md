‘Cutting-edge’ is the term usually associated with blockbuster product releases, yet the philosophy of product development central to the thinking of one of the great innovators in video games eschewed creating new technology in favor of finding ways to give life to the tried-and-true.

尖端 "这个词通常与大片产品的发布相关联，然而，视频游戏领域最伟大的创新者之一的产品研发理念的核心思想是放弃了创造新技术，转而寻找赋予久经考验的产品以生命。

The man was Nintendo’s Gunpei Yokoi, chief creative force behind many of the company’s iconic inventions like the GameBoy and the D-Pad. Yet despite a long list of accomplishments, spanning software, hardware and toys, Yokoi’s most enduring contribution may have been his product philosophy, often translated to the almost luddite-sounding ‘lateral thinking with withered technology.’

这个人就是任天堂的Gunpei Yokoi，该公司的许多标志性的发明，如GameBoy和D-Pad背后的首席创意力量。然而，尽管他在软件、硬件和玩具领域取得了一系列的成就，但Yokoi最持久的贡献可能是他的产品理念，常常被翻译成 "用枯萎的技术进行横向思考"。

The genius behind this concept is that for product development, you’re better off picking a cheap-o technology (‘withered’) and using it in a new way (‘lateral’) rather than going for the predictable, cutting-edge next-step.

**What is Lateral Thinking?**

Most product concepts are the result of iterative evolution. They tend to be slightly thinner, faster or differently hued than their competition. You can see them coming a generation away. By contrast lateral products are bold and surprising because they tackle their category orthogonally.

Take the iPod Shuffle: While many analysts predicted that Apple would release a down-market music player, nobody imagined they’d eliminate the screen and shape the device like a pack of gum. Lateral products don’t mind jettisoning industry-standard features and paradigms.

Iterative products might be hardest in execution (more on that soon), but lateral products tend to be hardest in conception. To build a lateral product, pick a starting point, the category or the technology. Since most of us work in a specific market but are technology agnostic, we’ll start with the category.

> Iterative products might be hardest in execution, but lateral products tend to be hardest in conception

Imagine you’re working at a beverage company and are responsible for a new soda launch. Obvious ideas might be to develop a new flavor (pomegranate-cinnamon), upgrade an ingredient (rainforest dew sweetener) or go with licensing (Big Bang Theory soda). However, these ideas aren’t lateral as you’re just replacing one product feature for another. Instead, you have to approach soda in a structurally different way. Here are two strategies you might employ:

**Soul Diving: What’s the Fundamental Product Purpose**

Focusing on the fundamental purpose of your product (its ‘soul’) empowers you to discard all of your accumulated assumptions. And this in turn will free you to take a new approach.

During a [rare interview](http://shmuplations.com/yokoi/), Gunpei Yokoi was asked for his opinion on games of the time. His response demonstrates soul diving at its finest:

> There’s a huge variety of console games out now, but to me, the majority of them aren’t actually ‘games.’ The word ‘game’ means something competitive, where you can win or you can lose. When I look at recent games, I see that quality has been declining, and what I’m seeing more and more of are games that want to give you the experience of a short story or a movie.

With our beverage venture we might ask, “What’s the real purpose of soda?” One idea might be that purpose of soda is on-the-go hydration, so a lateral move would be to drop the carbonation and additives, thus leaving us with bottled water.

**Cross-Pollinating Ideas**

Take your product category and then shuffle in a random idea. If creative sparks don’t fly, drop it and repeat the process until you stumble upon a combination that’s crazy enough to work.

> When I started Stockpickr it was the mating of my ideas on the Internet with my ideas for a new hedge fund. The best ideas always come from mating. Think of Hollywood. When they pitch an idea its never just “I have this idea”. Its always “It’s James Bond meets Titanic”

An obvious example of this would be Vitamin Water. A more creative beverage idea might be to combine soda and music, so that the bottle can be used as a musical instrument during consumption.

One should keep in mind that while cross-pollination is a fun approach, it can also be scattershot. So to avoid this Gunpei Yokoi would often cross-pollinate ideas with and under the constraint of what he called ‘withered technologies.’

**Avoiding the Cutting Edge**

More often than not startups and R&D labs take a new generation of technology and rush to apply this to their chosen product category.

The challenge of this approach is that it’s hard to get the cutting-edge to work well out of the gate. There are too many risky unknowns, which lead to compromises, bloated budgets and even wholesale cancellation. Competition is also tougher, with everyone bumping into each other trying to come up with a better mousetrap.

So while it’s a noble endeavor for you to develop a new soda sweetener with a modest 20% fewer calories, there are, as the military calls them, “known unknown” pitfalls. A supply shortage may skyrocket your target price point midway through development or an unseemly side effect may surface among a portion of your population. Even if everything goes smoothly, you may still wake up to a “bring back the original formula” petition which garners national press attention.

**Withered: Abundant, Well-Understood & Cheap**

Gunpei Yokoi believed that the rewards for using cutting-edge technology weren’t always proportional to the effort. That’s why he tried to limit himself to withered technologies. And it’s important to note that his use of the word ‘withered’ didn’t refer to old or obsolete technologies. This was a poor translation of the original, which was much closer in spirit to ‘weathered.’

Withered technologies are abundant, well-understood and cheap. Examples could include AA batteries, aluminum cans or the Python programming language. So for a soda executive high fructose corn syrup is withered, while premium organic agave syrup is not.

Limiting yourself to withered building blocks can be the difference between niche novelty and a mainstream blockbuster:

-   The cost savings allow you to price for everyone
-   The resource savings allow you to focus on innovating around the edges of your product
-   The time savings allow you to launch early and often
-   And with the supply abundance, you can go global

Withered constraints will push you creatively, yet allow you to scale to success.

**Combining the Two: A Case Study in Virtual Reality**

Sadly, Gunpei Yokoi’s biggest product failure came only two years before his untimely death. Despite Yokoi’s protests that the virtual reality console in his lab wasn’t ready for prime time, Nintendo launched the Virtual Boy to scathing reviews and lackluster sales. Some speculate the public embarassment led to his resignation. So it’s a measure of poetic justice that the Oculus Rift, which was acquired by Facebook for $2 billion and is poised to bring VR to the masses, was built using Yokoi’s philosophy.

While you may think of virtual reality as the definition of a cutting-edge category, the Oculus Rift’s two most important components are a cheap smartphone screen and a pair of fifty cent lenses. These two withered parts allowed for mainstream pricing ($350) and freed the team to work on peripheral innovations like decreasing latency and refining positional tracking. Had they gone with custom parts, they might have achieved a higher quality product but at the cost of niche pricing or absurd graphic card requirements.

Most people tend to assume that new products are the result of looking at tomorrow’s technologies and working backwards from there. Gunpei Yokoi had a different idea. He looked at present-day technologies and figured out how to package them into exciting products for the future.

What’s great about this approach is that it isn’t just good business, it’s also good fun. The process is more creative, the headaches less painful and the end result is more likely to delight, draw attention and win in the marketplace.

这个概念的天才之处在于，在产品开发中，你最好选择一种便宜的技术（“枯萎”），并以一种新的方式（“横向”）使用它，而不是选择可预测的、尖端的下一步。

**什么是横向思维？**

大多数产品概念是迭代演化的结果。它们往往比竞争对手稍微薄一些、快一些或颜色不同。你可以提前一代看到它们。相比之下，横向产品是大胆和令人惊讶的，因为它们从正交的角度来处理它们的类别。

以iPod Shuffle为例：虽然许多分析师预测苹果将推出一款下市场音乐播放器，但没有人想到他们会取消屏幕并将设备塑造成一包口香糖的形状。横向产品不介意放弃行业标准功能和范例。

迭代产品可能在执行上最难（很快会讲到），但横向产品在概念上往往最难。要构建一个横向产品，选择一个起点，类别或技术。由于我们大多数人都在特定的市场中工作，但技术上不可知，所以我们将从类别开始。

> 迭代产品可能在执行上最难，但横向产品在概念上往往最难。

假设你在一家饮料公司工作，负责推出一款新的苏打水。明显的想法可能是开发一种新口味（石榴肉桂），升级一种成分（雨林露甜味剂）或进行授权（《生活大爆炸》苏打水）。然而，这些想法不是横向的，因为你只是用另一个产品特性替换了一个。相反，你必须以一种结构上不同的方式处理苏打水。以下是你可以采用的两种策略：

**灵魂潜水：什么是基本产品目的**

专注于产品的基本目的（它的“灵魂”）使你能够摆脱你积累的所有假设。这反过来又会使你采取新的方法。

在一次[罕见的采访](http://shmuplations.com/yokoi/)中，横井軍平被问及他对当时游戏的看法。他的回答展示了灵魂潜水的精髓：

> 现在有各种各样的游戏机游戏，但对我来说，大多数游戏实际上都不是“游戏”。单词“游戏”意味着有竞争性，你可以赢也可以输。当我看最近的游戏时，我发现质量正在下降，我看到的越来越多的是想给你提供一个短篇小说或电影体验的游戏。

对于我们的饮料冒险，我们可能会问：“苏打水的真正目的是什么？”一个想法可能是苏打水的目的是在移动时水分补充，因此，一个横向的移动将是去除碳酸和添加剂，从而留下瓶装水。

**交叉污染思想**

将你的产品类别和一个随机的想法混合在一起。如果没有激发创意的火花，就放弃并重复这个过程，直到你偶然发现一个疯狂到足以奏效的组合。

> 当我开始Stockpickr时，它是我的互联网思想与我对一个新对冲基金的思想的结合。最好的想法总是来自交配。想想好莱坞。当他们提出一个想法时，它从来不只是“我有这个想法”。它总是“这是詹姆斯·邦德遇到泰坦尼克号”。

这个方法的一个明显的例子是维生素水。一个更有创意的饮料想法可能是将苏打水和音乐结合起来，使瓶子在饮用时可以用作乐器。

需要记住的是，虽然交叉污染是一种有趣的方法，但它也可能是零散的。为了避免这种情况，横井軍平经常在“枯萎技术”的约束下交叉污染思想。

**避免尖端技术**

往往情况下，初创企业和研发实验室会采用新一代技术，并匆忙将其应用到他们选择的产品类别中。

这种方法的挑战在于，很难让尖端技术一开始就很好地工作。有太多的风险未知因素，这导致妥协、庞大的预算甚至整个取消。竞争也更加激烈，每个人都试图争夺更好的陷阱。

因此，虽然开发一种新的苏打甜味剂，减少了20%的热量，这是一个值得追求的目标，但是，正如军方所称的，“已知的未知”缺陷仍然存在。在开发的中途，供应短缺可能会使你的目标价格飙升，或者在你的人口中出现不良的副作用。即使一切顺利，你仍然可能会醒来面临一个“恢复原配方”的请愿书，这会引起全国媒体的关注。

**枯萎：丰富、熟悉且便宜**

横井軍平认为，利用尖端技术的回报并不总是与努力成比例。这就是他试图限制自己使用枯萎技术的原因。重要的是要注意，他对“枯萎”一词的使用并不是指旧或过时的技术。这是原文的一个糟糕的翻译，更接近“风化”的精神。

枯萎技术是丰富、熟悉和便宜的技术。例如：AA电池，铝制罐或Python编程语言。因此，对于苏打饮料高级葡萄糖浆是枯萎的，而优质有机龙舌兰糖浆则不是。

将自己限制在枯萎的基础构件上可以使你从小众新颖到主流大片： ^257f32

-   成本节约使你可以为每个人定价
-   资源节约使你可以专注于创新产品的边缘
-   时间节约使你可以早期和经常发布
-   由于供应充足，你可以全球化

枯萎的限制将推动你的创造力，同时允许你扩展到成功。

**结合两者：虚拟现实的案例研究**

可悲的是，横井軍平在他不幸去世前仅两年遭遇了他最大的产品失败。尽管横井軍平反对他实验室中的虚拟现实控制台尚未准备好，但任天堂推出了Virtual Boy，受到了严厉的评论和平淡无奇的销售。一些人认为公众的尴尬导致了他的辞职。因此，讽刺的是，由Facebook以20亿美元收购并准备将VR带给大众的Oculus Rift采用了横井軍平的哲学。

虽然你可能认为虚拟现实是尖端技术的代表，但Oculus Rift的两个最重要的组件是一块便宜的智能手机屏幕和一对50美分的透镜。这两个枯萎的部分使得定价面向主流市场（350美元），并释放了团队的周边创新，例如降低延迟和改进定位跟踪。如果他们采用定制部件，他们可能会以更高的质量生产产品，但代价是小众定价或荒谬的图形卡要求。

大多数人往往认为新产品是从明天的技术出发，然后往回倒推而来。横井軍平有不同的想法。他看着现代技术，并想出了如何将它们打包成未来的激动人心的产品。

这种方法的好处在于，它不仅是好的商业，而且也很有乐趣。这个过程更具创造性，头痛不那么痛苦，最终结果更有可能令人愉悦、引人注目并在市场上获胜。
