In the midst of a pandemic, it’s delightful to imagine doing whatever you like without worrying about making a living.

Many years ago, when my son was 5, he got upside down on a long-term loan in Animal Crossing, Nintendo’s 2002 video game about running away from home to lead a prosaic life in an adorable animal village. The problem was familiar, although perhaps not to a kindergartner: He had spent his income on the trappings of consumer life—furniture, garments, accessories, even video games. But now he had no room for all that stuff, he explained to me. He also had no cash to pay off the mortgage, which the local real-estate tycoon, a raccoon named Tom Nook, had forced him to take out upon arrival. Until the note was paid, my son reasoned, he wouldn’t be able to take out _another_ loan—to fund a home expansion that would finally make room for all his purchases. “What should I do?” he asked.

For years, I spun this story as an example of games’ special ability to teach complexity. What the hell kind of video game consigns you to a mortgage when you boot it up? But Animal Crossing had taught my young son about the trap of long-term debt before he ever had a bank account.

Animal Crossing is back, and what a time for it to arrive. A new title in the franchise, New Horizons, launched in late March, just as many Americans were settling into quarantine; its players have since found [comfort](https://www.wired.com/story/rave-animal-crossing-new-horizons/) and [relief](https://www.wired.com/story/unbearable-lightness-animal-crossing/) in the game’s cute pastoralism, a reprieve from uncertainty. The title has [become so popular](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-07-animal-crossing-new-horizons-sales-top-2-6m-in-japan), in fact, that Nintendo Switch consoles have become about [as hard to find](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-08-nintendo-says-more-systems-on-the-way-as-switch-sells-out-worldwide) as hand sanitizer. Amid social and economic chaos, with most people holed up inside, the days having melted into a shapeless slurry, Animal Crossing serves up unexpected consolation by offering surrogate habits—a structured, if fictional, alternative to normal life.

Days pass in real time, and the seasons change too, along with the calendar. You can fish and catch bugs, plant trees or chop them down for wood. You can buy clothing, furniture, and other goods, or do odd jobs for the animals who live in town. You can work off that infernal mortgage, of course, but you can also choose not to, and Tom Nook will never evict you. Instead, you might bury treasure on the beach, or just watch the stars at night. In summer, the crickets chirp at dusk. When spring blooms, as it is now, the wind makes cherry blossoms dance over the streams.

The whole time my kid with the video-game mortgage was growing up, I insisted in [books](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/199599/animal_crossings_strange_.php) and during [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cklykZ0Nus) and [on late-night shows](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/d21xmf/the-colbert-report-ian-bogost) that games like Animal Crossing could help people better understand other big problems, like climate change or even pandemic flu (a topic I later [turned into a game](http://persuasivegames.com/game/killerflu), not that it made much of a difference). Today, my son is about to graduate from college and into the economic cataclysm that will likely become the coronavirus depression. He’s back home now, because his school closed down, playing the new Animal Crossing with the rest of us. Its lessons don’t seem so useful anymore.

Maybe I had it all wrong all those years ago. I had imagined Animal Crossing to be a game about the world, one that offered ingenious, if abstract, life lessons. But the players enjoying it in quarantine celebrate it for escapism, which any form of entertainment might provide. Neither interpretation seems quite right. Even though it can function as escapism, Animal Crossing isn’t a fantasy-world replacement from real life, absent all its burdens. But nor is it a handbook for how to live in actual reality more effectively—the most distinctive aspect of mortgage lending, after all, is the crushing weight of compounding interest, which enriches lenders that get bailouts if they fail. None of that stuff appears in the game at all.

Instead, Animal Crossing is a political hypothesis about how a different kind of world might work—one with no losers. Millions of people already have spent hours in the game stewing on that idea since the coronavirus crisis began.

Sequestered at home on lockdown, the NYU Game Center professor Naomi Clark recently offered a [compelling reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgEnbXPZX4s) of Animal Crossing to her students and colleagues, many of whom probably have been playing it to pass the time. The game, she argued, is a nostalgic fantasy for the Japanese _furusato_, a pastoral hometown.[\*](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/04/animal-crossing-isnt-escapist-its-political/610012/#correction2) Before industrialization, a seaside fishing village or hillside paddy-field farm might have sustained a simple, deliberate life of basic subsistence and straightforward agricultural trade, much like the life the player leads in Animal Crossing.

[Read: We need to stop trying to replicate the life we had](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/04/why-your-zoom-happy-hour-unsatisfying/609823/)

But the size and economies of these villages were too modest even to sustain their basic familial and mercantile needs, so the villages would take on collective debt—to pay for fishing nets and supplies, say. But nobody would ever pay back the debt, Clark explained. They didn’t have the money! Instead, it would bind the locals to their village—you owed something to the collective, so how could you ever leave? And so the community would persist, a tableau of georgic calm sealed inside the bottle of a company town.

Nintendo is a traditional, Japanese company, so Clark’s interpretation is convincing. The game has other distinctively Japanese elements that might not be immediately obvious to Western players, too. Tom Nook, for example, is not a raccoon but a tanuki (Tom Nook, tanuki, you get the picture), a [Japanese raccoon dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog) with a [long-standing folkloric history](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-tanuki-japan-s-trickster-god) as both a trickster and a symbol of wealth, much like the fox in the West. Among other things, the tanuki has enormous testicles (but not Tom Nook; this is a family game). Many Japanese woodblock prints depict a tanuki kneading its testes into the shape of various objects, such as raincoats or fishing nets. The supernatural industriousness of Tom Nook, who can divine manufactured goods from thin air in the game, takes on another meaning when seen through the lens of tanuki mythology.

The _furusato_ fantasy offers one view on the fusion of commerce and the countryside, but it doesn’t really land in the West, especially in America. Here, capitalism and pastoralism are often seen as opposing forces. So, too, personal benefit and collective good.

This goes all the way back to John Locke, who held that individuals had a right to turn natural resources that belonged to no one into individual property for personal use, through labor. The Lockean idea justified all manner of accomplishments and violations in American history, including the [colonial seizure of Native lands](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40231987?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) and the justification of resource extraction via the [efficiencies of industry](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3228543?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). In the nation that grew from those assumptions, the accrual of wealth became incompatible with a return to the land. Agrarianism forked into factory farming on the one hand or farm-to-table luxury on the other. And pastoralism never really got a foothold in America as it did in England or Japan: Land was so plentiful that its survival was taken for granted.

But according to the Tom Nook doctrine, pastoralism and capitalism coexist perfectly. You can fish for high-value red snappers and sell them to buy espadrilles for your character, or 1950s-diner furnishings for your house. Or you can fish for never-before-seen specimens, to donate them to the museum. Or you can cast a line just to enjoy watching the moon dance across the water. All of these activities are interchangeable and equally delightful. Animal Crossing sees no greater or lesser virtue in one than another.

This ambivalence extends to labor and commerce on Tom Nook’s island. To make the game’s economy operate, players can sell raw materials and manufactured items for currency (called “bells”), which can be used to buy other goods. Nook’s apprentices, Timmy and Tommy, run a shop that stocks a few things each day, but the two critters will also buy literally anything the player wants to get rid of: Fruit shaken off trees, insects snared from stumps, old cans or tires fished from the deep, lamps or tables fashioned from found wood and ore, garments that no longer spark joy.

Supply and demand still rule, with common items fetching fewer bells than rare ones. [Some](https://junkee.com/animal-crossing-tom-nook-oligarch/247431) [critics](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5xwg7/animal-crossings-tom-nook-pleasant-landlord-or-anarcho-capitalist) see Tom Nook as a capitalist oligarch, pressing players to become entrepreneurs who [farm high-value tarantulas](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-farm-tarantulas-in-animal-crossing-new-hori/1100-6475594/) for big profits. But Animal Crossing players are mostly foragers, and Tom Nook doesn’t seem that interested in capitalism. You can’t become an investor or much of a financier; a “stalk market” for turnip commodities is mostly a loser’s game best avoided. Nook never seems to benefit from his profits; he seems more like a reforming ecological collectivist, working behind the scenes to maintain the village’s fecund repleteness.

Price variation notwithstanding, Timmy and Tommy value any kind of effort the player wants to conduct as viable labor. Want to collect coconuts from the palm trees every three days? That’s fine. Want to travel abroad to mine iron for crafting park benches? They’ll buy those too. Want to catch butterflies? No problem. Every effort is valid, every accomplishment exchangeable for capital. Want to do no job whatsoever, but just sit on stumps and shake a tambourine? That’s fine too; there are no consequences for not earning “bells.” Nobody cares in Animal Crossing. You are okay.

For Americans playing the game as coronavirus lockdowns produce historic spikes in unemployment, the idea that any activity might be seen as viable work is a comfort, and perhaps even an aspiration. Imagine if everyone had a job that they enjoyed, that they were good at, and that could sustain them. What if they could thrive with no job at all, a step well beyond universal basic income? Even a month ago, such ideas would have felt preposterous beyond the cartoonish shores of a video game. But now they feel like dreams worth dreaming.

Conspicuous consumption still haunts the animal village. Drunk on the wealth from farming tarantulas, well-to-do villagers can pay off their home loans and acquire even bigger houses, decking them out with more goods. But here in quarantine, the drive to acquire virtual space and then fill it with virtual goods comes with a powerful injection of situational absurdity. What’s the rush to make progress in Animal Crossing when there’s nothing else to do, stuck at home as we are for an unknown, possibly interminable duration?

The consumerists will snare themselves in the end, anyway. After personal accomplishments run dry, well-off villagers will have nothing interesting to do with their money except to contribute to public-works projects in the village, like the construction of bridges and ramps that allow players to traverse the island’s rivers and mountains more easily. Investment in infrastructure is a common good, and it turns out that diverting private wealth into public benefit might even happen voluntarily if the spoils become boring enough.

That said, the game has added some features that risk undermining Animal Crossing’s careful balance of the market and the countryside. One is crafting, a video-game design pattern in which players must accrue raw materials and fashion them into more complex objects for further use. In New Horizons, crafting is an unending malaise. The player is forced to acquire sticks and stones to make axes or nets or fishing rods, but these basic tools break quickly after a few dozen uses. You end up using axes or shovels to mine rocks for iron, just to use that iron to build slightly less flimsy tools.

On first blush, crafting almost commands the player to see the island as a mere strip mine—not to mention neighboring islands visited only for resource extraction and then forgotten forever. But though it is a toy world, the island is not a microcosm; its own resources are limited, and the greater the local population (eight human players can “live” on one console), the more competition exists for those resources. Is it better to omit this truth, to pretend that resources are infinite, as many games do, or to force the player to contend with the scarcity and violence intrinsic to manufacturing? It would be disproportionate to conclude that merely representing the dynamic implies that the game endorses it. And yet, Animal Crossing doesn’t decry the practice either. Instead, the conflict persists forever, like the island sunset chasing the horizon.

Another gut punch comes from the addition of an in-game smartphone, new to the series in this title. Tom Nook gives it to players to store crafting recipes and design custom clothing in virtual apps. There’s also a loyalty-program app, called Nook Miles, which doles out a scrip currency for player accomplishments, such as catching 10 bugs or chatting with three animal neighbors in a day.

Here too, the game seems to undermine its own principles at first. Animal Crossing used to be self-directed, and players would often chat with the animal characters in order to be assigned favors to complete. But now the smartphone serves up infinite ideas: One completed task just spawns another in its place. Players are motivated to do specific things for extrinsic rewards rather than doing whatever they like for the sake of intrinsic pleasure, and knowing it will be valued.  

And yet, isn’t this exactly the trade-off that real smartphones demand, a constant lifeline to new options, all more or less the same in nature, judged valuable by how many likes or hearts they accrue? But remember, this is a video-game iPhone, not a real one. Smartphones are always deceptive, Tom Nook seems to warn, but maybe they can be used differently. Perhaps the problem with real life isn’t the devices, but the [hyperemployment](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/hyperemployment-or-the-exhausting-work-of-the-technology-user/281149/) that turns every activity conducted upon them into secret labor from the start.

Late one night recently, a barrage of texts blew up my phone. They were from my friend Frank Lantz, the director of the NYU Game Center, who also designs [cult](https://www.wired.com/story/the-way-the-world-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-paperclip/) [games](https://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/video/hey-robot-with-john-mulaney/4124120).

“I hate Animal Crossing,” Lantz’s opening message read.

He and his wife and collaborator, Hilary, had sat down to play it, looking for the same low-key, cute coziness that everyone else found comforting. “It is the most boring, long-winded, repetitive, condescending, infantile bullshit we’ve ever seen.” After a few more invectives, he posed a question: “Do people find comfort in tedious, bureaucratic, pandering authoritarianism?”

[Read: Video games are better without gameplay](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/10/dont-play-the-goose-game/600472/)

The answer, which Lantz knew before he asked, is: Of course they do. Americans in particular are [addicted to bureaucracy’s directed control](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-police-state-america/608365/) even as they cry yawps of independence and self-actualization.

But with coronavirus deaths soaring and the real economy tanking, Animal Crossing might inspire Americans to reclaim structure and routine, and to motivate it toward modest rather than remarkable ends. Nobody really wants to live a pastoral-capitalist equilibrium of humdrum labor—unless that’s what everyone wants, actually, and not even so secretly. Civic life, after all, coheres not in abstract fantasies about politician-heroes, but in habitual practices that take place in real communities. All video games [aestheticize busywork](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/10/dont-play-the-goose-game/600472/). But few make it feel like freedom.

很多年前，当我的儿子5岁时，他在《动物之森》中得到了颠覆性的长期贷款，这是任天堂2002年的电子游戏，关于离家出走，在一个可爱的动物村过着平淡的生活。这个问题很熟悉，虽然对于一个幼儿园的孩子来说，也许并不陌生。他把收入都花在了消费生活的外衣上 家具，服装，饰品，甚至是电子游戏。他向我解释说，现在他没有地方放这些东西了。他也没有现金来偿还抵押贷款，当地的房地产大亨，一个叫汤姆-努克的浣熊，在他来的时候就强迫他把抵押贷款拿出来。我儿子的理由是，在还清欠条之前，他无法再贷款--为房屋扩建提供资金，以便最终为他所有的购买行为腾出空间。"我应该怎么办？"他问。

多年来，我一直把这个故事作为游戏教导复杂性的特殊能力的例子。什么样的电子游戏会让你一开机就陷入抵押贷款的境地？但在我的小儿子拥有银行账户之前，《动物之森》就已经教会了他长期债务的陷阱。

动物之森》又回来了，它的到来真是太及时了。特许经营权中的一个新标题 "新地平线 "于3月下旬推出，就在许多美国人陷入隔离状态时；此后，它的玩家们在游戏中可爱的牧民中找到了安慰和解脱，从不确定性中得到了缓和。事实上，这个标题已经变得如此受欢迎，以至于任天堂Switch游戏机已经变得像洗手液一样难找。在社会和经济的混乱中，大多数人都躲在屋里，日子已经融化成了一团无形的浆糊，《动物之森》提供了意外的安慰，它提供了代用的习惯--一种结构化的，虽然是虚构的，但却能替代正常生活的选择。

导读：你已经生活在隔离区里了

日子在实时流逝，四季也随着日历的变化而变化。你可以捕鱼捉虫，种树或砍树做木头，你可以买衣服、家具和其他商品，也可以给住在城里的动物做零工。你可以买衣服、家具和其他商品，或者为住在城里的动物们做一些零工。当然，你可以工作来偿还那该死的抵押贷款，但你也可以选择不工作，汤姆-诺克绝不会赶你走。相反，你可以在海滩上埋下宝藏，或者只是在晚上看星星。夏天，黄昏时分，蟋蟀鸣叫。春暖花开的时候，就像现在这样，风让樱花在溪流上跳舞。

在我那个拿着电子游戏抵押贷款的孩子成长的整个过程中，我在书本上、在讲座上、在深夜节目中都坚持认为，像《动物之森》这样的游戏可以帮助人们更好地理解其他的大问题，比如气候变化甚至是大流感（这个话题后来我把它变成了游戏，并没有起到多大的作用）。今天，我的儿子即将从大学毕业，进入经济大灾难，很可能成为冠状病毒大萧条。他现在回家了，因为他的学校关门了，和我们其他人一起玩新的《动物之森》。它的课程似乎不再那么有用了。

也许多年前我就想错了。我曾想象《动物之森》是一款关于世界的游戏 它提供了巧妙的，尽管是抽象的，但却是生活的教训。但在隔离区里享受游戏的玩家们却在庆祝它的逃避主义，而任何形式的娱乐都可能提供这种逃避主义。这两种解释似乎都不太正确。即使它能起到逃避现实的作用，《动物之森》也不是一个来自现实生活的幻想世界替代品，缺席了所有的负担。但它也不是一本关于如何更有效地生活在实际现实中的手册--毕竟，抵押贷款最独特的地方是复利的压倒性重压，这让那些一旦失败就会得到救助的贷款人富得流油。这些东西在游戏中根本就没有出现。

相反，《动物之森》是一个政治假设，关于一个不同类型的世界可能如何运作--一个没有失败者的世界。自从冠状病毒危机开始以来，已经有数百万人在游戏中花费数小时来思考这个想法。

封闭在家中闭关锁国的纽约大学游戏中心教授纳奥米-克拉克（Naomi Clark）最近向她的学生和同事们提供了一个关于《动物之森》的令人信服的解读，他们中的许多人可能已经在玩这个游戏来打发时间。她认为，这款游戏是对日本furusato--牧民故乡的怀旧幻想，*在工业化之前，一个海边的渔村或山坡上的稻田农场可能维持着简单、刻意的生活，基本的自给自足和直接的农业贸易，就像玩家在《动物之森》中过的生活一样。

阅读。我们需要停止试图复制我们的生活。

但这些村庄的规模和经济都太小，甚至无法维持基本的家庭和商业需求，所以这些村庄会集体举债，比如说，支付渔网和补给品。但没有人愿意偿还债务，克拉克解释说。他们没有钱! 相反，这将把当地人和他们的村庄捆绑在一起--你欠了集体的东西，所以你怎么能离开？因此，社区将坚持下去，在公司镇的瓶子里密封的乔治亚平静的表象。

任天堂是一家传统的、日本的公司，所以克拉克的解释让人信服。这款游戏还有其他独特的日本元素，西方玩家可能也不会马上看出来。比如汤姆-诺克并不是一只浣熊，而是一只tanuki（汤姆-诺克，tanuki，你懂的），这是一种日本的浣熊犬，在民间有着悠久的历史，它既是一种诡计，也是财富的象征，就像西方的狐狸一样。其中，探月有巨大的睾丸（但不是汤姆-诺克，这是一个家庭游戏）。许多日本木版画描绘了一只探月将其睾丸揉成各种物体的形状，如雨衣或渔网。Tom Nook在游戏中可以凭空占卜出制成品，这种超自然的勤劳，从探月神话的角度来看，就有了另一种意义。

毛里幻想为商业与乡村的融合提供了一种观点，但它并没有真正在西方，尤其是在美国落地。在这里，资本主义和牧业往往被看作是对立的力量。所以，个人利益和集体利益也是如此。

这要追溯到约翰-洛克，他认为，个人有权通过劳动，把不属于任何人的自然资源变成个人财产，供个人使用。洛克的思想为美国历史上的各种成就和违法行为提供了理由，包括殖民时期对土著人土地的攫取，以及通过工业的效率来证明资源开采的合理性。在从这些假设中成长起来的国家，财富的积累与回归土地变得不相容。农业主义一方面分叉成工厂化农业，另一方面又分叉成从农场到餐桌的奢侈品。而畜牧业从来没有真正得到一个立足点 在美国，因为它在英国或日本。土地是如此丰富，它的生存被认为是理所当然的。

但根据汤姆-诺克学说，牧业和资本主义完美共存。你可以钓到价值很高的红鲷鱼，然后卖掉它们来为你的角色买帆布鞋，或者为你的房子买1950年代的晚餐家具。或者你可以钓到前所未见的标本，把它们捐给博物馆。或者您可以抛出一条鱼线，只为欣赏月亮在水面上跳舞。所有这些活动都是可以互换的，同样令人愉悦。动物之森》认为，这些活动没有孰优孰劣之分。

这种矛盾性延伸到汤姆-诺克岛上的劳动和商业。为了使游戏的经济运行，玩家可以出售原材料和制造品来换取货币（称为 "铃铛"），这些货币可以用来购买其他商品。Nook的学徒Timmy和Tommy经营着一家商店，每天都会储存一些东西，但这两只小动物也会购买任何玩家想要处理掉的东西。从树上摇下来的水果 从树桩上抓来的昆虫 从深海里捞出来的旧罐头或轮胎 用捡来的木头和矿石做成的灯或桌子 不再能带来快乐的服装

供求关系仍然是主宰，普通物品的价格比稀有物品的价格要低。一些评论家认为汤姆-诺克是一个资本主义寡头，逼迫玩家成为企业家，养殖高价值的狼蛛以获取巨额利润。但《动物之森》的玩家大多是觅食者，汤姆-诺克似乎对资本主义没那么感兴趣。你成不了投资者，也成不了什么金融家，萝卜商品的 "梗市场 "多半是个失败者的游戏，最好不要去做。努克似乎从来没有从他的利润中获益，他似乎更像是一个改革的生态集体主义者，在幕后努力维持村庄的丰满。

尽管价格不一，但Timmy和Tommy重视玩家想要进行的任何一种努力，将其视为可行的劳动。想每隔三天从棕榈树上收集椰子？那很好。想去国外开采铁器来制作公园长椅？他们也会买的。想抓蝴蝶？没问题。每一种努力都是有效的，每一种成就都可以换成资本。想不做任何工作，只是坐在树桩上摇手鼓？那也行，不挣 "铃铛 "是没有后果的。在《动物之森》里没人管你。你是可以的。

对于美国人玩游戏，因为冠状病毒封锁产生了历史性的失业率高峰，任何活动都可能被视为可行的工作的想法是一种安慰，甚至可能是一种愿望。想象一下，如果每个人都有一份他们喜欢的工作，他们擅长的工作，并且可以维持他们的生活。如果他们在没有工作的情况下也能茁壮成长，远远超出全民基本收入的一步呢？即使在一个月前，这样的想法在电子游戏的卡通海岸之外也会觉得荒唐。但现在，它们就像是值得梦想的梦。

显性消费仍然困扰着动物村。醉心于养殖狼蛛所带来的财富 富裕的村民可以偿还房贷，购置更大的房子 用更多的商品来装饰它们。但在隔离区这里，获取虚拟空间，然后用虚拟商品来填充的动力，却注入了强大的情境荒诞性。当我们和我们一样被困在家里，在一个未知的、可能是无休止的时间里，无事可做的情况下，急于在《动物之森》中取得进步是为了什么呢？

反正最后消费主义者会自食其果。在个人成就耗尽之后，富裕的村民们除了为村里的公共工程做贡献之外，他们的钱也不会有什么有趣的事情可做，比如修建桥梁和坡道，让玩家可以更轻松地穿越岛上的河流和山脉。投资基础设施是一种共同的利益，事实证明，如果战利品变得足够无聊，将私人财富转为公共利益甚至可能是自愿的。

尽管如此，游戏增加了一些功能，这些功能有可能破坏《动物之森》对市场和乡村的精心平衡。其中之一是手工制作，这是一种电子游戏的设计模式，玩家必须积累原材料，并将其制作成更复杂的物品，以便进一步使用。在《新地平线》中，手工制作是一种无休止的苦恼。玩家被迫获得木棍和石头来制作斧头或网或鱼竿，但这些基本工具在使用几十次后很快就会损坏。你最终会用斧头或铁锹去开采岩石以获得铁器，只是为了用这些铁器来打造稍微不那么脆弱的工具。

乍一看，手工制作几乎命令玩家把这个岛看成是一个单纯的条形矿场--更不用说邻近的岛屿了，只为了资源开采而来，然后永远被遗忘。不过虽然是玩具世界，但小岛并不是一个缩影，它本身的资源是有限的，当地人口越多（一个游戏机上可以 "住 "8个人类玩家），对这些资源的竞争就越大。是省略这个事实，像很多游戏一样假装资源是无限的，还是强迫玩家去面对制造业内在的稀缺和暴力？如果认为仅仅表现这种动态就意味着游戏认可这种动态，那就太不相称了。然而，《动物之森》也没有谴责这种做法。相反，冲突永远存在，就像岛上的夕阳追逐地平线。

另一个让人痛心疾首的地方来自于游戏中增加了一部智能手机，这是系列在本作中新加入的。Tom Nook把它交给玩家，让玩家在虚拟应用中存储制作配方和设计定制服装。此外，还有一个名为 "Nook Miles "的忠诚度计划应用，它可以为玩家的成就发放一种代币，比如在一天内抓到10只虫子或与三个动物邻居聊天。

在这里，游戏一开始似乎也破坏了自己的原则。动物之森》过去是自导自演的，玩家经常会和动物角色聊天，以获得分配的好处来完成。但现在智能手机提供了无限的创意。一个任务完成后就会产生另一个任务 玩家会为了外在的奖励而去做特定的事情，而不是为了内在的快乐而为所欲为，并且知道会受到重视。 

然而，这不正是真正的智能手机所要求的取舍，不断有新的选择，所有的选择在本质上都差不多，以积累多少赞或心来判断其价值吗？但请记住，这是一款电子游戏iPhone，而不是真正的iPhone。智能手机总是具有欺骗性，汤姆-诺克似乎警告说，但也许它们可以用不同的方式。也许现实生活中的问题并不是设备，而是超强的就业能力，从一开始就把在设备上进行的每一项活动都变成了秘密劳动。

最近的一个深夜，一连串的短信炸开了我的手机。是我的朋友弗兰克-兰茨发来的，他是纽约大学游戏中心的主任，也是设计邪教游戏的人。

"我讨厌《动物之森》" Lantz的开场白是这样写的。

他和他的妻子及合作者希拉里坐下来玩，寻找着和大家一样的低调、可爱的惬意。"这是我们见过的最无聊、最长篇大论、最重复、最高傲、最幼稚的废话。" 又骂了几句之后，他提出了一个问题。"人们是否在乏味的、官僚的、迎合的专制主义中找到了安慰？"

阅读。电子游戏没有游戏性更好

答案是，兰茨在问之前就知道了。他们当然知道 美国人尤其沉迷于官僚机构的定向控制，即使他们喊着独立和自我实现的口号。

但随着冠状病毒死亡人数的飙升和实体经济的下滑，《动物之森》可能会激励美国人重新找回结构和常规，并激励它朝着适度而非显著的目的前进。没有人真的想过一种牧民与资本主义平衡的平淡劳动生活--除非这就是大家想要的，实际上，甚至不是那么秘密。公民生活毕竟不是凝聚在关于政治家英雄的抽象幻想中，而是凝聚在现实社区中的习惯性实践中。所有的电子游戏都将繁忙的工作美学化。但很少有游戏能让人感到自由。
