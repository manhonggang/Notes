The Big List Of Game Design 

Book Recommendations:
	• Game Design Books… Recommendations? (TIGSource Forums)
	• Must Read Game Development Books (Gamedev.Stackechange)
	• Good Game Design Books (Gamedev.Stackechange)
	
I highly recommend Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game Design (by Scott Rogers… he was also involved in the creation of the Maximo series and God of War 1). The book offers really good practical advice and is nicely structured and well thought out. Moreover it also contains lots of fine illustrations and is primarily tailored towards action oriented games (especially platformers). 
Two more game design books that are probably good:

 The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses (Note: I haven’t completely read it yet but from what I’ve read so far (2/10) it seems also interesting).
 
 Game Feel: A Game Designer’s Guide to Virtual Sensation (Note: I have not personally read this book yet…but I want to check it out in the future… according to reviews it seems to be good)
