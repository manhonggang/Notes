_The following was published in the April 2008 issue of [Game Developer](http://www.gdmag.com/homepage.htm) magazine…_

Amongst computer games, the strategy genre is one of the oldest and proudest, with a strong tradition, running from _M.U.L.E._ to _Civilization_ to _Starcraft_ and beyond. Nonetheless, certain design mistakes keep being made over and over again. Here are seven of the most common:  

**1\. Too much scripting**

Strategy games have a direct lineage from board games, and the fun of playing the latter comes from understanding the rules and mechanics of the game world and then making decisions that have consequence within that world. Computerized strategy games allow a single player to experience this same world on his or her own. At some point, however, strategy developers began to create lengthy, scripted scenarios as the single-player portion of their games. (In fact, the recent _World in Conflict_ shipped without a single-player skirmish mode altogether.) These scenarios have a peculiar feeling – they use some of the same rules as the core game while often violating others. The AI takes action depending not on its own development rate or strategic priorities but on whether the human has hit certain triggers. In many scenarios, in fact, the human cannot even lose because – when defeat approaches – the script will freeze the AI and starting pumping in free units for the player. Further, these scenarios are often built around specific “objectives” to achieve, such as destroying a specific structure or capturing a single point. This artificial environment takes decision-making away from the player. Not only is there only one path to victory, but the player’s performance along that path may not even matter. Games without interesting decisions get boring quickly. Fortunately, some recent strategy games, such as _Sins of a Solar Empire_ and _Armageddon Empires_, have returned to open-world, random-map gameplay – without pre-set objectives or artificial triggers – and are reminding us of the joy of cohesive and consistent strategy games.  

**2\. Too much stuff**

The temptation to pile extra units and buildings and whatnot onto to an already complete design is strong. Indeed, I have seen many developers describe games as simply a collection of stuff (“18 Weapons! 68 Monsters! 29 Levels!”) This approach is wrong-headed. A game design is a collection of interesting decisions, and the “stuff” in the game is there not just to fill space but to let you execute decisions. Games can provide too few options for the player but – more commonly – games provide too many. How many is just right? Obviously, there is no magic number, but it is possible to come up with a good rule-of-thumb for how many different options a player can keep in his or her mind before everything turns to mush. Blizzard uses the number 12 to make sure their RTS’s don’t get too complex. _StarCraft_ averaged 12 units per side. So did _WarCraft 3_ (not counting Heroes). And you can bet that _StarCraft 2_ is going to be in that neighborhood as well. In fact, Blizzard has already announced that, for the sequel, they will be removing some of the old units to make room for the new ones. Players must be able to mentally track their in-game options at one time, and putting too many choices on the table makes it impossible to understand the possibility space.

**3\. Limited play variety**

No matter how good your game, it is going to get stale after awhile. It’s unfortunate when a great game doesn’t take the few steps necessary so that players can change the settings to create alternate play experiences. _Company of Heroes_ is an incredible tactical RTS, a watershed moment for the genre – but the game allows neither Axis vs. Axis battles nor matches with more than two teams. This design choice may fit the fiction of WWII, but it significantly reduced the game’s play variety. An example of an RTS that got this right is the _Age of Empires_ series. Not only could you mix-and-match any combination of civilizations and players and teams, but you could also design your own map scripts. I remember one interesting _Age of Kings_ map that had almost no wood but tons of stone and gold, which turned the game’s economy upside-down. The game even allowed multiple players to control the same single civilization (one could control the military, the other the economy, for example). Thus, I’ve played 2-vs-3 games of _AoK_ where the sides with 2 civs was actually controlled by 4 players (and, in fact, handily won the game!) These simple variations probably doubled the life-span of _AoK_ amongst my group of friends. Significantly, these options should be orthogonal to the game’s core mechanics – they need to add variety without adding complexity.

**4\. Black box mechanics**

Sometime during the late-90’s, around when _Black & White_ was being developed, the concept of an interface-less game came into vogue. The idea was that interfaces were holding games back from larger, more mainstream audiences. Ever since then, I have noticed a discernible trend to hide game mechanics from the player. _Age of Kings_ shipped in 1999 with an incredible reference card listing every cost, value, and modifier in the game. For modern RTS’s, however, it’s unusual if the manual actually contains numbers. I want to emphasize that the answer here is not to bathe the players in complicated mathematics in the name of transparency. Instead, designers should think of their interfaces as having two levels: a teaching level and a reference level. The teaching level focuses on first-time players who need to know the basics, like how to build a tank and go kill the bad guys. The reference level should answer any question the player can think of about how a game mechanic works. It is perfectly fine, by the way, to put this info inside of a separate in-game resource, like the Civilopedia. _Rise of Legends_ implemented an interesting version of this two-interfaces idea. Most of the popup help in the game had an “advanced” mode that you could unlock by holding down a key, giving you significantly more details about the game’s underlying mechanics.

**5\. Locked code/data**

Protecting your code and data is a very natural instinct – after all, you may have spent years working on the project, developing unique features, pushing the boundaries of the genre. Giving away the innards of your game is a hard step for many developers, especially executives, to take. Nonetheless, we released the game/AI source code for _Civ 4_ shortly after shipping, and – so far – the results have been fantastic. Three fan-made mods were included in the game’s second expansion pack – Derek Paxton’s _Fall from Heaven: Age of Ice_, Gabriele Trovato’s _Rhye’s and Fall of Civilization_, and Dale Kent’s _WWII: The Road to War_ – and so far, these scenarios have been heralded as one of _Beyond the Sword_’s strongest features. These mods would have been nowhere near as deep or compelling (or even possible) if we had not released our source code. For many PC developers, I’m preaching to the choir, so I’d like to be very clear that the problem is worst amongst strategy games. For whatever reason (perhaps the lack of a pioneering developer like id Software?), strategy developers have been much more closed off to modding than their shooter and RPG brethren. There are exceptions, like Blizzard’s fantastic scenario editor for _WarCraft 3_, but by and large, strategy modders do not have many places to turn for platforms on which to work, which was one reason we felt compelled to focus on modding for _Civ 4_. Giving stuff away can feel good. It should also feel smart.

**6\. Anti-piracy paranoia**

The damage that piracy does to our industry is impossible to calculate but also impossible to ignore. Few company heads can be as brave as Stardock’s Brad Wardell, who chose to leave out copy protection altogether for the _Galactic Civilization_ series. (They encourage paying customers by providing on-line updates to players with legitimate serial numbers.) Having some sort of mechanism to stop casual piracy is a given in the industry, but what is not a given is the hoops companies will make their customers jump through just to be able to start the game. The most important question to ask is “will this added security layer actually increase our sales?” A good place to be lenient, for example, is with local multi-player games – in other words, can players without the CD join a multi-player game hosted by a legitimate copy. _Starcraft_ let you “spawn” extra copies of the game that could only join local multi-player games. Allowing unlimited LAN play was our unofficial policy for _Civ 4_ as well. The game does a disk check when opening the executable but not when you actually launch the game; thus, a group of 4 friends could just pass one disk around for local multiplayer games. We do not believe players are willing to buy extra discs just for LAN parties, which are rare events. However, we would love for new players to be introduced to _Civ_ in these environments, encouraged by their friends who are already fans. At some point, they are going to want to try single-player – in which case, it is time for a trip down to the local retailer to buy their own copy.

**7\. Putting story in the wrong places**

Story and games have a checkered history. Too many have suffered from boring cut-scenes, stereotyped characters, and plots that take control away from the player. Especially problematic are games which don’t let the player fast-forwarding through cringe-worthy dialogue. The worst offense, however, is when a story gets stuck somewhere it really doesn’t belong. Like in a strategy game. After all, strategy games are the _original_ games. Humans first discovered gameplay with backgammon and chess and go; it’s a noble tradition. The “story” in a strategy game is the game itself. Picking a specific example, how much better of a game would _Rise of Legends_ have been if Big Huge Games had given up on creating a story-based campaign and instead iterated on the excellent turn-based _Conquer the World_ strategy layer from _Rise of Nations_? Ironically, the campaign mode was my favorite way to play _RoL_. I loved that you could only acquire technologies and advanced units on the strategic map between missions, which helped simplify the core RTS game. However, I enjoyed the campaign in spite of the story, not because of it. The key point here is that, for the sake of chasing a story, Big Huge Games missed a big opportunity to match a great core RTS game with a simple, overarching strategy layer that could be infinitely replayable. They are not alone; almost every other RTS developer seems to be falling into the same trap, and it is time for this trend to stop.

在电脑游戏中，策略类游戏是最古老、最值得骄傲的游戏之一，具有强大的传统，从_M.U.L.E._到_Civilization_再到_Starcraft_等等。尽管如此，某些设计上的错误还是不断地被犯。这里有七个最常见的。 

**1\. 太多的脚本**

战略游戏与棋盘游戏有着直接的联系，玩棋盘游戏的乐趣来自于对游戏世界的规则和机制的理解，然后在这个世界里做出有影响的决定。计算机化的战略游戏允许单个玩家独自体验这个相同的世界。然而，在某些时候，策略开发商开始创造冗长的、有脚本的场景作为他们游戏的单人部分。事实上，最近的《冲突世界》(World in Conflict)在发货时完全没有单人小规模战斗模式）。这些场景有一种奇特的感觉--它们使用了一些与核心游戏相同的规则，但又经常违反其他规则。人工智能采取的行动不是取决于它自己的发展速度或战略优先事项，而是取决于人类是否达到了某些触发点。事实上，在许多场景中，人类甚至不会输，因为--当失败临近时--脚本会冻结AI，并开始为玩家注入自由单位。此外，这些场景往往是围绕着特定的 "目标 "来实现的，例如摧毁一个特定的结构或占领一个点。这种人为的环境将决策权从玩家手中夺走。不仅只有一条通往胜利的道路，而且玩家在这条道路上的表现甚至可能并不重要。没有有趣决定的游戏很快就会变得无聊。幸运的是，最近的一些战略游戏，如《太阳帝国之罪》（Sins of a Solar Empire）和《末日帝国》（Armageddon Empires），已经回到了开放世界、随机地图游戏--没有预先设定的目标或人为的触发因素--并且正在提醒我们有凝聚力和一致性的战略游戏的乐趣。 

**2\. 太多的东西**

在一个已经完成的设计上堆积额外的单位和建筑什么的，这种诱惑力是很强的。事实上，我已经看到许多开发者把游戏描述成简单的东西的集合（"18种武器！68种怪物！29个关卡！"），这种做法是错误的。一个游戏设计是一个有趣的决定的集合，游戏中的 "东西 "不只是为了填补空间，而是为了让你执行决定。游戏可以为玩家提供太少的选择，但更常见的是，游戏提供了太多的选择。多少才算合适？显然，没有一个神奇的数字，但有可能想出一个好的经验法则，即在一切都变成一团糟之前，玩家可以在他或她的头脑中保留多少不同的选择。暴雪用12这个数字来确保他们的RTS不会变得太复杂。星际争霸》平均每方有12个单位。战争游戏3》也是如此（不包括《英雄》）。而且你可以打赌，《星际争霸2》也会在这个范围内。事实上，暴雪已经宣布，对于续集，他们将删除一些旧的单位，以便为新的单位腾出空间。玩家必须能够在精神上一次性跟踪他们在游戏中的选择，而把太多的选择放在桌子上，就不可能了解可能性空间。

**3\. 有限的游戏种类**

无论你的游戏有多好，一段时间后它都会变得陈旧。当一个伟大的游戏没有采取一些必要的措施，让玩家可以改变设置来创造另一种游戏体验时，这是不幸的。英雄连》是一款令人难以置信的战术性RTS，是该类型游戏的分水岭--但游戏既不允许轴心国对战，也不允许两队以上的比赛。这种设计选择可能符合二战的虚构，但它大大减少了游戏的多样性。一个正确的RTS例子是《帝国时代》（Age of Empires）系列。你不仅可以混合搭配任何文明、玩家和团队的组合，而且还可以设计你自己的地图脚本。我记得有一张有趣的《列王的时代》地图，几乎没有木材，但有大量的石头和黄金，这使游戏的经济发生了翻天覆地的变化。该游戏甚至允许多个玩家控制同一个单一的文明（例如，一个可以控制军事，另一个控制经济）。因此，我玩过2对3的_AoK_游戏，其中有2个文明的一方实际上是由4个玩家控制的（而且，事实上，轻松地赢得了游戏！）这些简单的变化可能使_AoK_在我的朋友群中的寿命延长了一倍。重要的是，这些选项应该与游戏的核心机制正交，它们需要在不增加复杂性的情况下增加多样性。

**4\. 黑盒机制**

在90年代末的某个时候，大约在《黑与白》的开发过程中，无界面游戏的概念开始流行起来。这个想法是，界面阻碍了游戏向更大、更主流的受众的发展。从那时起，我就注意到一个明显的趋势，即向玩家隐藏游戏机制。1999年，《列王纪元》（_Age of Kings_）在发货时有一张令人难以置信的参考卡，列出了游戏中的每一个成本、价值和修改器。然而，对于现代RTS来说，如果手册中真的包含数字，那就很不寻常了。我想强调的是，这里的答案不是以透明的名义让玩家沐浴在复杂的数学中。相反，设计者应该把他们的界面看作是有两个层次的：一个是教学层次，一个是参考层次。教学层的重点是那些需要了解基本知识的初次接触的玩家，比如如何建造坦克和去杀坏人。参考层面应该回答玩家能想到的关于游戏机制如何运作的任何问题。顺便说一下，把这些信息放在一个单独的游戏资源中是完全可以的，比如《民俗百科全书》。_Rise of Legends_实现了这种双界面想法的一个有趣版本。游戏中的大多数弹出式帮助都有一个 "高级 "模式，你可以通过按住一个键来解锁，为你提供关于游戏基本机制的更多细节。

**5\. 锁定的代码/数据**

保护你的代码和数据是一种非常自然的本能--毕竟，你可能已经花了好几年时间在这个项目上，开发了独特的功能，推动了这个类型的边界。泄露你的游戏内部是许多开发者，尤其是高管，难以迈出的一步。尽管如此，我们在发货后不久就发布了_Civ 4_的游戏/AI源代码，而且--到目前为止--其结果非常好。在游戏的第二个扩展包中包含了三个粉丝制作的MOD--德里克-帕克斯顿的_Fall from Heaven。冰河时代_，加布里埃尔-特罗瓦托的《雷伊和文明的衰落》，以及戴尔-肯特的《二战。到目前为止，这些场景被誉为《超越之剑》最强大的功能之一。如果我们没有发布我们的源代码，这些mods就不会有这么大的深度和说服力（甚至不可能）。对于许多PC开发者来说，我是在向唱诗班说教，所以我想很清楚地说明，这个问题在战略游戏中是最严重的。不管是什么原因（也许是缺乏像id Software这样的先锋开发商？），战略开发商比他们的射击游戏和RPG游戏的兄弟们对修改要封闭得多。也有例外，比如暴雪为《战国争霸3》开发的奇妙场景编辑器，但总的来说，策略游戏的修改者没有很多地方可以找到工作的平台，这也是我们感到不得不专注于《战国争霸4》修改的原因之一。赠送东西的感觉很好。它也应该感觉很聪明。

**6\. 反盗版的妄想症**

盗版对我们行业造成的损害是无法计算的，但也是无法忽视的。很少有公司的负责人能像Stardock的Brad Wardell那样勇敢，他选择在《银河文明》系列中完全不使用复制保护。(他们通过向拥有合法序列号的玩家提供在线更新来鼓励付费用户）。拥有某种机制来阻止偶然的盗版行为是行业中的必然现象，但不是必然现象的是，公司会让他们的客户为了能够开始游戏而跳过一些障碍。要问的最重要的问题是 "这个增加的安全层是否真的能增加我们的销售？" 例如，一个宽松的好地方是本地多人游戏--换句话说，没有CD的玩家能否加入由合法副本主持的多人游戏。星际争霸》允许你 "生成 "额外的游戏副本，这些副本只能加入本地多人游戏。允许无限制的局域网游戏也是我们对_Civ 4_的非官方政策。游戏在打开可执行文件时进行磁盘检查，但不是在你实际启动游戏时进行检查；因此，4个朋友组成的小组可以在本地多人游戏中传递一个磁盘。我们不相信玩家愿意为了局域网聚会而购买额外的磁盘，因为局域网聚会是很少见的活动。然而，我们希望新玩家能在这些环境中被介绍给_Civ_，在他们已经是粉丝的朋友鼓励下。在某些时候，他们会想要尝试单人游戏--在这种情况下，是时候去当地零售商那里购买自己的副本了。

**7\. 把故事放在错误的地方**

故事和游戏有一段不光彩的历史。太多的游戏因枯燥的场景、千篇一律的人物和剥夺玩家控制权的情节而受到影响。特别有问题的是那些不允许玩家快进的游戏，这些游戏的对话令人厌恶。然而，最糟糕的是，当一个故事被卡在不属于它的地方。比如在战略游戏中。毕竟，战略游戏是原创游戏。人类首先发现了双陆棋、国际象棋和围棋的游戏性；这是一个高贵的传统。战略游戏中的 "故事 "就是游戏本身。挑一个具体的例子，如果Big Huge Games放弃创造一个基于故事的战役，而是在《Rise of Nations》中优秀的回合制_Conquer the World_战略层上进行迭代，《Rise of Legends》会是一个多好的游戏？讽刺的是，战役模式是我最喜欢的玩法_RoL_。我喜欢你在任务之间只能在战略地图上获得技术和高级单位，这有助于简化核心RTS游戏。然而，尽管有故事，我还是喜欢战役，而不是因为它。这里的关键点是，为了追逐一个故事，Big Huge Games错过了将一个伟大的核心RTS游戏与一个简单的、可无限重玩的总体战略层相匹配的重大机会。他们并不孤单；几乎所有其他RTS开发商似乎都落入了同样的陷阱，现在是停止这种趋势的时候了。
