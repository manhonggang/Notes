_Note: This article was written a while ago, and as a fast moving company our team has continued to grow and evolve. To get to know our latest team members, visit [this file on the Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/814575098768004426/)._

Just under a year ago, we only had one full-time core product designer and a few of us chipping in part-time toward feature work. It was tough to keep up with all the engineers, and we knew we had to hire fast to maintain high quality designs. But we also wanted to make sure it was done thoughtfully. Each person you add to a small team has a major effect in how you work — if you’re rowing on a small boat you notice each individual rower much more than you would if you were on a cruise ship.

Fast-forward a year. We now have a team of eight designers, a more seasoned and established culture with collaborative critiques, and clearer objectives and areas of ownership. We’re still new as a group and there’s a lot to improve, but we’re proud to have the foundations in place to build the future of design tools together.

At Figma, we believe design is best done in the open. After taking some time to ensure a transparent culture internally, we realized we wanted to share our methods with the broader design community. To put our money where our mouth is, we thought this would be a fun opportunity to provide an inside look into how we built our team.

[Our hiring process](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-design-team/#our-hiring-process)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we first started interviewing designers, we suffered from unclear role expectations, inconsistencies in our interview questions and unfocused debates about candidates. There was a lot of room to improve, but as an early start up, we were all so busy wearing different hats that slowing down to rethink this process felt like a bit of a hurdle initially.

Fortunately, Niko attended [a wonderful and timely talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyFVpXUHVXs&feature=youtu.be) by [Joel Califa](https://twitter.com/notdetails) on building design teams, which gave us a new tool to guide our process thoughtfully. As Joel explained, it takes place with three phases:

1.  **Learn:** Look at every job description you can. Learn from people who’ve built teams (run questions by other leaders). Build an understanding of which skills or traits could be valuable on your team.
    
2.  **Analyze:** Use that understanding to build a comprehensive list of skills. Filter that list down to skills that the company genuinely needs. Filter that down to skills that the Design team should be responsible for. Then to baseline skills that every Designer needs to know.
    
3.  **Evolve:** Have you realized a new gap on your team? Has the company’s or team’s needs changed? What do you need right now? When possible, grow people internally.
    

Following this guide, we independently wrote up what we wanted out of our next team member, then started merging and consolidating that list in Figma to build consensus. It looked something like this:

![image 1 noah](https://images.ctfassets.net/1khq4uysbvty/6f5NNLml68qiSiO8QO4scQ/eefe7a7ca3d2e35fb410203434c417c7/image_1_noah.gif?&w=736)

Building out our requirements together in Figma

It’s very rare to find designers who can do absolutely everything, and this process helped us focus on what was actually necessary versus what we were willing to compromise on.

Here’s where we landed for the core expectations of a Product Designer at Figma:

![noah image 8](https://images.ctfassets.net/1khq4uysbvty/2Lin72yM1i0meQ46uGym8o/d11a4a5ed502c4923fc0ecc07e400304/noah_image_8.png?&w=736)

We then ran a similar exercise for cultural components of the interview to make sure we brought on people who would be a good fit for Figma, aligned with the company’s core values (Be Bold, Be Inclusive, Have Fun).

![noah image 9](https://images.ctfassets.net/1khq4uysbvty/4kHUZIGkmQiyskwcCWYc8m/3eebbe22a011c8d33271135de6855277/noah_image_9.png?&w=736)

We’d recently taken a diversity and inclusion workshop, which explained how people often bend criteria during interviews unconsciously to fit their existing bias. This applies to both soft skills and hard skills — for example, if you think good designers are assertive, you may look for it even if you agreed as a team it wasn’t important for the role. To help combat this, we took the list of qualities we wanted and used it directly in our interview feedback form in Lever (our recruiting and hiring tool) to prompt meaningful focused feedback rather than just an open ended text field.

![noah image 3](https://images.ctfassets.net/1khq4uysbvty/5ucUyHUA7KMOySqIu8AKqU/5453caece6b9d944c7bc21a79a15d2a6/noah_image_3.png?&w=736)

We added the requirements directly into our feedback tool, Lever, for clearer assessments

We also judged ourselves on the existing criteria. We were hoping doing this would reveal new gaps in our team to inform ways to round out what we were missing, but actually there were not many surprises. It was still valuable though because we wouldn’t want to evaluate others on something we couldn’t evaluate ourselves on first. It was also a humbling experience and ensured we were all being realistic about strengths and weaknesses.

Of course, the hiring exercise alone doesn’t just magically drop the people you need into your team — a lot of work has to be done sourcing, asking around, and meeting people to find the right fit. But at least now we had the knowledge of what we actually needed to properly conduct the search. One trick that helped us a lot was working closely with our amazing recruiter, Korin, by embedding her into the design team, joining our critiques and team meetings so she could help us hire the right talent and speak to what we do day-to-day more accurately with first-hand experience.

[Who we are](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-design-team/#who-we-are)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![noah image 4 figma design team](https://images.ctfassets.net/1khq4uysbvty/5qf5J9wmw8IE4AeeQUiSmK/0277b4caca0acb90fb3a53f06b38355e/noah_image_4_figma_design_team.png?&w=736)

### [Lucy](https://dribbble.com/lucyne)

First, Lucyné (Lucy) had applied to us online, and when we saw [her portfolio](https://dribbble.com/lucyne) we were stunned by her beautiful motion and visual explorations. She’d worked across various domains from making websites and working in agencies to designing the interface for [the first handheld CNC machine](https://www.shapertools.com/). She’s one of the most inquisitive people we met, always looking to understand more about why things are the way they are — we’re lucky to have her onboard.

### [Marcin](https://aresluna.org/)

Then came Marcin — a UI veteran who’s worked at Google, Medium, and Code for America. From having [replicated Pac-man into a Google doodle](https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man) (down to matching the bugs from the arcade game), to caring about [tiny details like underlines](https://medium.design/crafting-link-underlines-on-medium-7c03a9274f9) and [quotation marks](https://medium.design/quotation-marks-c8993b54417c) on Medium, to building a [custom urban planning application](https://medium.com/@mwichary/youre-a-street-designer-you-just-dont-know-it-yet-b5e83620e428), we knew having someone with his passion for quality craft, tooling, and typography would be perfect for a design tool like Figma.

### [Bradee](https://twitter.com/bradee)

It’s hard to find a clearer fit than someone who’s spent the last 10 years of her life thinking about and building creative tools. Most of Bradee’s tenure was spent at Adobe, much of it on Photoshop. She’s passionate about designing in the open and creating tools that help us all create a more inclusive world. She loves new and novel interactions, having [presented with Apple on stage at WWDC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvgs1N_Xkdo) to showcase the Photoshop touchbar. We love her creative expression in and outside of work — she recently designed and implemented a custom animated Halloween character on a big projection screen with camera and voice rigs to interact with trick-or-treating passerby's.

### [Tori](https://twitter.com/torihinn)

Finally, the most recent addition to the team, we are lucky to have found Tori as our first Creative Director who will be helping us help evolve the Figma brand. Previously a freelance art director and designer, she’s worked with clients like Apple, Etsy, Google, and many others. Tori has a wonderful leadership approach, carefully listening to and understanding the team’s goals and motivations to build products collaboratively. As someone who cares deeply about empowering others, we knew she’d be a great manager and leader for our communication design team. She also [makes epic gradients](https://gradientsdaily.com/).

Lucy, Marcin, Bradee and Tori are joining the rest of the Figma design team:

### [Niko](https://twitter.com/nikolasklein)

During a hack day around Design Tools, Niko started working with a team building Sketch Runner, a plugin for Sketch. At the time, he was still studying Interaction Design in Schwäbisch Gmünd (it has a 🦄 as coat of arms!). His Sketch Runner experience made him think more deeply about the tools he was using, and after graduating (and a stop at Shopify in Ottawa) he decided to work on design tools full time.

### [Peter](https://twitter.com/Neobarnabas)

Because of his background in advertising, Peter is a bit of a visual fire hydrant. He’s Figma’s Communication Designer, so he works cross functionally to make product GIFs, internal presentations, websites and other assets. A lot of his inspiration comes from nature, which he considers to be the best designer.

### [Rasmus](https://twitter.com/rsms)

As the longest standing member of the team having joined ~3 years ago, Rasmus has been a core backbone of Figma Design. A Swedish native, he was one of the first employees of Spotify in Sweden in 2006 where he led the company’s design and product direction. In 2011, he moved to the United States to work at Facebook and then Dropbox. He recently designed an open-source typeface for interface design, [Inter UI](https://rsms.me/inter/), which has since been used by the likes of Github, Japanese soccer league, and the UK gov.

### [Noah](https://twitter.com/nlevin)

Noah moved back to San Francisco last year to be Figma’s first Design Manager. Before that he led the design team at ClassPass in NYC, and the iOS Search team at Google in Mountain View. He also spent some time teaching designers to code as an advisor at Framer. He studied Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon and is a Pittsburgh native who’s convinced it’s the most underrated city in the world.

We’re proud of the diversity of skills each member has to offer, making it easier to tackle a range of problems in different ways:

![noah image 10](https://images.ctfassets.net/1khq4uysbvty/46wPwgHphm0sSSaEICoMGK/6851854a6df0f9ffe50528f127a45356/noah_image_10.gif?&w=736)

[Getting to know each other](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-design-team/#getting-to-know-each-other)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To help us understand each others’ preferences and styles, Marcin recently had a fun idea of running a “Trading Cards” activity together in Figma. We wanted to know things like: who prefers working in the morning vs the evening? What parts of the design process do you feel most comfortable with vs challenged by? What’s your design super power? Are you more introverted or extroverted? We felt that filling this out in the form of a fun trading card would be a fun team activity, so we made them during one of our weekly design critiques:

If you’re interested in trying this out with your own team, [we made a template in Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/814575098768004426/) for you to try out. Feel free to adapt it to questions most relevant to your team and what you’d like to discover. This could also make for a fun onboarding activity for new team members.

[What’s next…](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-design-team/#what-s-next)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Naturally, to narrow down what we were looking for, we ran our hiring exercise again. Here’s what we uncovered as core needs for each role:

![noah image 11](https://images.ctfassets.net/1khq4uysbvty/1MThonMsUocqWcUg2aCKcM/b52627f7ad2c28d15f33948b12f73edc/noah_image_11.png?&w=736)

For the full time role we tailor it a bit to a designer who should be excited about experimentation and growth-related projects. Whereas for an internship, we care most about candidates being hungry to learn and hard working since the role requires less experience:

![noah image 13](https://images.ctfassets.net/1khq4uysbvty/6sKtMoB40oW2CeaK0MsYGC/10f8fc985a122ca89cfe547e114ced2a/noah_image_13.png?&w=736)

We hope open sourcing our requirements like this makes for a smoother interview experience so you’ll know more about what we’re looking for.

# 译文

就在不到一年前，我们只有一个全职的核心产品设计师，还有几个人兼职从事功能工作。要跟上所有工程师的步伐是很困难的，我们知道我们必须快速招聘，以保持高质量的设计。但我们也想确保它是经过深思熟虑的。你加入一个小团队的每一个人都会对你的工作方式产生重大影响--如果你在一艘小船上划船，你会比在游轮上更注意到每一个划手。

快进一年。我们现在有了一个由八名设计师组成的团队，有了一个更加老练和成熟的文化，有了协作性的批判，有了更加明确的目标和自主的领域。我们作为一个新的团队，还有很多需要改进的地方，但我们很自豪，因为我们已经具备了共同打造未来设计工具的基础。

在Figma，我们相信设计最好是在开放中进行。在花了一些时间来确保内部的透明文化之后，我们意识到我们希望与更广泛的设计社区分享我们的方法。为了让我们的钱花在刀刃上，我们认为这将是一个有趣的机会，让我们了解我们如何建立我们的团队。

## 我们的招聘过程
当我们刚开始面试设计师时，我们遭受了角色期望不明确、面试问题不一致以及对候选人的辩论不集中等问题。有很多需要改进的地方，但作为一个早期的创业公司，我们都忙于戴着不同的帽子，以至于放慢脚步重新思考这个过程，最初感觉有点障碍。

幸运的是，Niko参加了Joel Califa关于建立设计团队的精彩而及时的讲座，这给我们提供了一个新的工具来指导我们的流程思考。正如Joel所解释的那样，它有三个阶段。

- 学习。看看你能看到的所有工作描述。向建立过团队的人学习（由其他领导提出问题）。了解哪些技能或特质对你的团队有价值。

- 分析。利用这种理解来建立一个全面的技能清单。将该列表过滤到公司真正需要的技能。将其筛选为设计团队应该负责的技能。然后筛选出每个设计师都需要了解的基本技能。

- 不断发展。你是否意识到你的团队出现了新的缺口？公司或团队的需求是否发生了变化？你现在需要的是什么？在可能的情况下，在内部培养人。

按照这个指南，我们独立地写出了我们对下一个团队成员的要求，然后开始在Figma中合并和整合这个清单，以建立共识。它看起来是这样的。


很少有设计师能做到绝对的一切，这个过程帮助我们专注于实际需要的东西与我们愿意妥协的东西。

这就是我们对Figma产品设计师的核心期望的落脚点。

然后，我们对面试中的文化元素进行了类似的练习，以确保我们带来的人适合Figma，并与公司的核心价值观（大胆、包容、开心）保持一致。

我们最近参加了一个多样性和包容性的研讨会，它解释了人们如何在面试中经常不自觉地弯曲标准以适应他们现有的偏见。这既适用于软技能，也适用于硬技能--例如，如果你认为优秀的设计师是自信的，你可能会寻找它，即使你作为一个团队同意它对这个角色并不重要。为了帮助对抗这一点，我们把我们想要的品质列表，并将其直接用于我们在Lever（我们的招聘和招聘工具）中的面试反馈表，以促使有意义的重点反馈，而不仅仅是一个开放式的文本字段。

我们也根据现有的标准对自己进行了评判。我们希望这样做能发现我们团队中的新的差距，从而为如何完善我们的缺失提供信息，但实际上并没有多少惊喜。不过这还是很有价值的，因为我们不愿意先用一些自己无法评估的东西来评估别人。这也是一次惭愧的经历，确保了我们都能实事求是地看待自己的优势和劣势。

当然，单单是招聘工作并不能神奇地把你需要的人丢进你的团队，还需要做很多工作，寻找、打听、见人，才能找到合适的人选。但至少现在我们有了知识，知道我们到底需要什么来正确地进行搜索。有一招对我们帮助很大，那就是与我们了不起的招聘人员Korin密切合作，将她嵌入到设计团队中，加入我们的点评和团队会议，这样她就可以帮助我们雇佣到合适的人才，并以第一手的经验更准确地讲述我们的日常工作。有兴趣和你的团队一起运行这个项目吗？试试这个模板吧。

## 我们是谁

露西
首先，Lucyné(露西)在网上向我们申请，当我们看到她的作品集时，我们被她优美的动作和视觉探索所震惊。她曾在不同的领域工作过，从做网站、在代理公司工作，到设计第一台手持数控机床的界面。她是我们遇到的最有好奇心的人之一，她总是想了解更多关于事物为什么是这样的--我们很幸运有她的加入。

Marcin
然后，Marcin来了--一个曾在Google、Medium和Code for America工作过的UI老手。从将《吃豆人》复制到谷歌的涂鸦中（甚至与街机游戏中的错误相匹配），到关心Medium上的下划线和引号等微小的细节，再到建立一个定制的城市规划应用程序，我们知道，拥有他对优质工艺、工具和排版的热情的人将是Figma这样的设计工具的完美人选。

Bradee
很难找到一个比一个花了10年时间思考和打造创意工具的人更合适的人选。Bradee的大部分任期都是在Adobe公司度过的，其中大部分时间都在Photoshop上。她热衷于在开放的环境中进行设计，并创造工具，帮助我们所有人创造一个更加包容的世界。她喜欢新奇的交互方式，曾在WWDC上与Apple一起上台展示Photoshop的触摸条。我们喜欢她在工作和工作之外的创意表达--她最近设计并实现了一个定制的万圣节动画角色，在一个大的投影屏幕上，用摄像头和语音装备与不给糖就捣蛋的路人互动。

Tori
最后，团队的最新成员，我们很幸运地找到了Tori作为我们的第一个创意总监，她将帮助我们帮助Figma品牌的发展。她之前是一名自由艺术总监和设计师，曾与苹果、Etsy、谷歌等客户合作过。Tori有着出色的领导力，她会认真倾听并理解团队的目标和动机，协同打造产品。作为一个非常关心赋予他人权力的人，我们知道她会是我们传播设计团队的优秀管理者和领导者。她还会制作史诗级的梯度。

Lucy、Marcin、Bradee 和 Tori 将加入 Figma 设计团队的其他成员。

尼科
在一次围绕设计工具的黑客日活动中，Niko开始和一个团队一起开发Sketch Runner，这是一个Sketch的插件，当时他还在Schwäbisch Gmünd学习交互设计。当时，他还在Schwäbisch Gmünd学习交互设计（它的校徽是🦄！）。Sketch Runner的经历让他对自己使用的工具有了更深入的思考，毕业后（在渥太华的Shopify停留了一段时间），他决定全职从事设计工具的工作。

彼得
由于他的广告背景，Peter是一个有点像视觉消防栓的人。他是Figma的传播设计师，所以他跨职能工作，制作产品GIF、内部演示、网站和其他资产。他的很多灵感来自于自然，他认为自然是最好的设计师。

Rasmus
Rasmus在3年前加入团队，是团队中工作时间最长的成员，他是Figma Design的核心骨干。他是瑞典人，2006年，他是Spotify在瑞典的第一批员工之一，在那里他领导了公司的设计和产品方向。2011年，他来到美国，先是在Facebook工作，后来又在Dropbox工作。最近，他设计了一个用于界面设计的开源字体Inter UI，此后该字体被Github、日本足球联盟和英国政府等使用。

诺亚
Noah去年搬回旧金山，成为Figma的第一位设计经理。在此之前，他曾在纽约的ClassPass领导设计团队，在山景城的Google领导iOS搜索团队。他还在Framer担任顾问，花了一些时间教设计师编码。他在卡内基梅隆大学学习人机交互，是土生土长的匹兹堡人，他坚信这是世界上最被低估的城市。

我们为每个成员提供的技能的多样性感到自豪，这使得我们更容易以不同的方式解决一系列问题。

## 互相了解

为了帮助我们了解彼此的喜好和风格，Marcin最近有一个有趣的想法，就是在Figma一起开展 "交易卡 "活动。我们想知道的事情有：谁更喜欢在早上和晚上工作？在设计过程中，你对哪些部分感到最舒服，哪些部分受到挑战？你的设计超能力是什么？你是比较内向还是外向？我们觉得以有趣的交易卡的形式来填写这些内容会是一个有趣的团队活动，所以我们在每周的一次设计评论中制作了这些卡片。

如果你有兴趣和自己的团队一起尝试，我们用Figma做了一个模板供你尝试。你可以根据与你的团队最相关的问题和你想发现的问题来调整它。这也可以成为新团队成员的一个有趣的入职活动。

## 下一步是什么...
当然，为了缩小我们的需求范围，我们再次进行了招聘工作。以下是我们发现的每个角色的核心需求。

对于全职岗位，我们会对设计师进行一些调整，他应该对实验和成长相关的项目感到兴奋。而对于实习生，我们最关心的是应聘者是否有学习的欲望，是否努力工作，因为这个角色对经验的要求较低。

我们希望像这样开放我们的需求，让你的面试体验更顺畅，让你更了解我们在寻找什么。

想一起工作吗？在这里申请吧!
