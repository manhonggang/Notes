Giant Sparrow/Ian Dallas (What Remains of Edith Finch) - official AMA!

Hey folks! Posting this thread for [u/GiantSparrow](https://www.reddit.com/user/GiantSparrow/), the dev team behind the very, very recently released [What Remains of Edith Finch](https://store.playstation.com/#!/cid=UP2470-CUSA06886_00-EFINCHPS4GAME001?smcid=pdc:us-en:pdc-games-detail-what-remains-of-edith-finch-ps4:leadproductinfo-buy-download:what-remains-of-edith-finch:up2470-cusa06886_00-efinchps4game001:emcid_null) and [The Unfinished Swan](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/the-unfinished-swan/cid=UP9000-CUSA00695_00-UNFINISHEDSWANP4?smcid=pdc:us-en:pdc-games-detail-what-remains-of-edith-finch-ps4:leadproductinfo-buy-download:what-remains-of-edith-finch:up2470-cusa06886_00-efinchps4game001:emcid_null).

Ian Dallas, Giant Sparrow's creative director, will be answering questions. I'll also be helping here and there - I'm Jeff Legaspi, part of the publishing team at Annapurna Interactive.

Ian will start answering questions around 11am Pacific, but feel free to post questions in advance!

POSSIBLE SPOILERS! Do you consider the connection in Edith Finch to Unfinished Swan to be canon? Or was that just a fun little reference/Easter egg? The way I see it, it's canon and draws a clear connection to the protagonist of Unfinished Swan and his adventures in that world, but perhaps as the creator you've got a different take on it.

-   Report
    

Yes, I'd consider it canon.

Also worth pointing out, since I've seen some confusion about this online: Milton is The King, not the protagonist, in The Unfinished Swan. The protagonist already has his own perfectly serviceable name, Monroe.

What remains of Edith Finch?

Changing publishers and making the switch from Sony to Annapurna Interactive. I would like to know why the switch happened and how (if you can talk about it, of course).

Extra question: how would you define your relationship with Annapurna? They seem to endorse a lot of experimental and artistic projects (Gorogoa, the Artful escape, etc.) and I’m eager to see them evolve in the gaming landscape, but I would love your take on the subject.

-   Report
    

On our end, "the switch" happened when the head of the external development team at Sony asked if I could step into his office for a minute. It was one of those meetings that come out of the blue that can go a lot of different ways. And I looked around the room and was like, "why are all these other people joining us for this meeting too. Uh oh."

That was the first time I'd heard talk about Annapurna buying the game from Sony.

In the months leading up to that, a lot of our friends who used to work at Sony had moved over to Annapurna. A lot of those folks had been working with on Edith Finch for several years at that point, so I think they felt like (a) this was a game that would be a really good fit for Annapurna, and (b) they had some confidence that they (and we) could pull it off.

So on our end, the transition was pretty easy. Day-to-day, we're still working with a lot of the same people on the publisher side that we've always been working with. In a way, staying at Sony actually would have been stranger, since we would have had to get used to a whole new set of producers.

Our relationship with Annapurna has been very open and positive, quite similar to the way we used to interact with Sony. It helps that both sides have very similar goals: trying to make something that nobody's ever seen before.

As a creative director can you describe what you do on a day to day basis whilst developing What Remains of Edith Finch? Did this differ at all as your role on The Unfinished Swan?

-   Report
    

What I do on a given day varies a LOT based on where we are in the production process. Early on, when we're in pre-production, I spend a lot of time hunting for references -- doing image searches, reading books, watching movies, etc. And making tons of little prototypes. Often on What Remains of Edith Finch I'd be working on half a dozen prototypes at a time, jumping around when I got bored with one or excited about another.

At some point those prototypes start to get far enough along that they need help from other departments, so then I start working with our animator, tech artist, modelers, etc. Sometimes I writeup docs, but mostly those are for my benefit, to try and organize my thoughts. I share them with people but nobody reads / remembers them. Mostly we look at reference images and videos and discuss what we're going for in terms of the overall feel.

In the middle of production, which in Edith Finch meant that we'd have maybe 4-6 stories in various stages of active development spread across all our departments, I spend a lot of my day in informal meetings, chatting with 2-3 people giving feedback on brainstorming.

I myself mostly was working on crazy new prototypes up until the very end of the project.

Also, on this game I was responsible for all of the 3d text animations and interactions, so I spent a lot of time working and tuning that system.

And now that we're at the end of production, I spend my time talking about the game to anyone who will listen :)

I just asked our QA lead and our Annapurna producer and they said we don't have a Platinum trophy because "we were not allowed to."

As a small scale game, Sony's policy is that we should deny our fans the satisfaction of a Platinum trophy. Those are just my words, btw, I think Sony's official documentation phrases it slightly differently.

The typical dev answer is "Sony wouldn't let us", which is total garbage. Just push back even a tiny bit and basically any game could if My Name Is Mayo could.

So I started playing last night almost as soon as my pre-order unlocked on PS4, thinking I would play for a few minutes and put it down. I couldn't stop playing until I the credits rolled and then I had to go back and experience a couple of stories again. Edith Finch was a really incredible experience, thank you and the rest of Giant Sparrow for sharing it.

My question is, what was it like going from such a minimalistic approach in visual design in The Unfinished Swan to the complete 180 in Edith Finch?

Aside from just the graphical fidelity, which is impressive, there's so much color, clutter and detail packed into every room. I had to stop and zoom in to read book titles and see photographs at almost every step I took. It reminded me of stepping into my own grandparents house and seeing there personalities and histories laid bare, and it really sold me on the Finch's being this family I had to know more about.

What kind of bike do you ride? How many bikes do you own? If you had to make a game about biking, what kind of game would it be?

-   Report
    

Interesting question!

I ride a Trek 7.2 FX. It's a very basic, sturdy commuter bike I bought on Craigslist for, like, $300. I've had several bikes stolen over the years in Los Angeles (usually because I did something stupid, like leaving it locked to my car's bike rack accidentally when I left to go the Game Developer's conference for a week).

My philosophy now is that my bike will eventually get stolen, so I appreciate it while it's here but I'm not super attached to it. I'd rather have a bike that's cheap enough that I don't have to worry about it getting stolen and can just leave it anywhere. The first bike I lost, which was sorta expensive and a gift, I still think about that bike from time to time. I wonder how it's doing and whether anyone rides it anymore.

I'd love to make a game about biking. We actually tried to make a story in What Remains of Edith Finch about mountain biking at night. It's a beautiful and terrifying experience, at least judging from YouTube videos like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plWz-DgYu1Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plWz-DgYu1Q). But we never figured out how to tell an interesting story, or how it would end in a satisfying way, so we shelved it.

It's unlikely that we'd be adding anything in the form of DLC etc, but it's not possible. We've joked about doing a "Finch Petz" DLC that explores the lives of several pets in the house. The more we talk about it, the less is starts to feel like a joke.

One of the things we also wanted to do initially in the game was to have guest developers contribute stories. That didn't end up happening, but I could see doing something like that as a fun way to expand the universe a bit and explore our existing family members (or new ones) a bit.

What was the most heartbreaking thing to cut? Were there additional family members/story elements that just didn't make it into the final game?

How many iterations did the stories go through? Did any of the stories that we played through start out radically different than what we got in the finished game?

How hard/fun was it to design the secret passageways throughout the house to get to the various rooms?

-   Report
    

Gregory's story almost got cut. And so did Lewis'. Those would have been pretty hearbreaking. But at the time they were sensible requests to try to bring the game into a shipping state by the time we needed to be finished, so I understood and seriously considered the requests.

But in terms of things we actually had to cut, I don't think any of the stories we cut were heartbreaking to me because they were all cut for a very good reason: they didn't work very well and didn't have a clear path to getting better. With a lot of energy I'm sure we could have made them better, but I don't know what they would have looked like so I don't have any heartache for them.

In terms of stories we cut that I really wish I could have spent more time on because I liked them and thought they had potential, there was one based on Borge's The Aleph that was presented as a landscape made entirely of text. That could have been great. But not in any reasonable timeframe, so we cut it.

The secret passageways were all pretty fun to work on, since most of them were goofy prototypes Ben Esposito made and they're all very limited, constrained things. Vs the rest of the game that is just stupidly elaborate and complicated and wonderful but in a very different way.

I don't want to overstate this, but I think this game is incredible. My top PS3 game was Heavy Rain. This is the first time I've felt this blown away by a non-VR game since Heavy Rain.

Hello, thanks for doing the AMA.

Two questions here. Giant Sparrow has made two games now that have been well received. Can you explain how your company culture is a contributor to your success?

I'm not a fan of FP games where I see a dot on the screen 24/7, my character can't holster a weapon and no animations exist for picking up items. Can you explain why these things exist in some FP games, including those with big budgets, and why they sometimes don't exist in others?

-   Report
    

I think our games follow a very different production process, which is kind of necessary given that they're trying to achieve different goals, but also helps contribute to making them FEEL different at the end of it.

Our company culture is kinda anarchic. Nobody really knows what we're making. We have a (hopefully) clear idea of the feeling we want that game to have (in Edith Finch that was "evoking the sublime horror of nature", but not what the theoretical game is that's going to achieve that.

We try a lot of things to get there and then we do our best to learn from those mistakes. We have very few meetings. In the middle of production, when there's lots to talk about, we tried to at least have all of our meetings on the same day (Monday), and then the rest of the week is clear.

My hope is that people feel empowered to make their own decisions and to fight for what they believe in by spending the time and energy to try and verify their ideas by getting them into the game and making them work. It's not always collaborative in that sense, sometimes it's more like a war, with everyone fighting for their side, but ultimately for the common good.

With regards to not holstering your weapon, I remember the developers of the first Deus Ex talking about that specifically, and how most players were confused about crowds reacting in panic to a drawn weapon, since players just considered it part of their toolkit, not an aggressive move. So it's tricky.

Yeah, I hate games where you have a fifth of your screen taken up with a gun the entire time.

Hello there Ian! Thanks for posting on [r/PS4](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/), it means a lot to us. I've kept my eye on What Remains of Edith Finch since the day it was announced. But I have one important ( for me at least) question: I loved a game known as Firewatch. It was a sleeper hit for me. The mystery kept me going and the slow but quite developed gameplay felt amazing to experience. I adore games that put their emphasis on story and truly hope that What Remains of Edith Finch delivers. Since I enjoyed it, how likely am I to enjoy your game? I'm at the brink of buying right now ;)

Also, a bonus question (feel free to skip it if you wish this to remain a detail for players to find out): how long is your game? As someone who's always trying to justify their purchases by the length of the game I'm just itching to know.

-   Report
    

I think if you liked Firewatch you're probably someone who's interested in exploring things, both new types of games and, in a more concrete way, exploring the natural world. Also, I think to enjoy a game like Firewatch you're probably someone who's not afraid to invest yourself emotionally in a game, which means you'll get a lot more out of the experience than someone who's just playing it for the non-emotional aspects, like graphics or the joy of movement etc. All of which is to say that I can 100% guarantee you will enjoy What Remains of Edith Finch. OK, not really, but I'd take that bet.

-   Report
    

If you ask me, Edith Finch is far better than Firewatch. In fact it's the best game in this genre. I'm pleased to see Metacritic has Editch Finch on 89, while Firewatch was 76.

I'm a big fan of this genre. People aren't going to like me saying this but I think Firewatch and Gone Home are a bit over rated, while Dear Ester and Everybody's Gone to The Rapture are under-rated. I'm glad to see Edith Finch is getting the review scores it deserves. Hope the sales are also as strong.

Please tell me you are still here! My wife and I just came from our first play session moments ago and are both welling up with tears over the story and the overwhelming amount of detail put forth in building the Finch household. Everything is top notch thus far and Giant Sparrow is looking to take over That Game Company as my favorite developer.

We were hooked after seeing [the first game trailer](https://youtu.be/Dc_2NOLQNIg) and I'm guessing Annapurna felt exactly the same after Sony's E3 press event in 2015. Here's hoping that they allow you to spread those Giant Sparrow wings even further in the years ahead.

Each game genre has their own challenges to developing them, such as rhythm games requiring fine precision in actions or open world and a huge amount of different environment interactions to contend with.

What are some of the challenges in developing a heavy story/narrative oriented game?

-   Report
    

In our case, not having any idea what the story should be until you're almost done making the game. We don't start out trying to tell a story. We're trying to evoke feelings that we ourselves don't entirely understand, like "what I remember about being on a swingset as a child", and the story doesn't come until the game itself is pretty far along. So you have to work backwards and say for something that feels the way this does, what story would feel that way and also help draw players attention to all the various things we want them to be thinking about. Like names. That was a big one for us. We had 13 family members + spouses and getting players to remember names was a constant challenge, so in dialogue we were always trying to find ways to elegantly remind players of who was who.

Also, for an experience / story that's so personal, a lot of it relies on encouraging the player to get into a certain mindset and then bring their own feelings to that. And it's really hard to predict how any of that is going to work until the game is nearly done and players can experience it. But of course by that point it's too late to make big changes.

There's a lot of guesswork and prayer in what we do.

Hi there, to both Ian and Jeff! I really appreciate you taking the time to answer our questions, and I've been looking forward to your game for what feels like well over a year now! I'm currently in the midst of finishing up my last week of the first year of my PhD so I haven't gotten to play What Remains of Edith Finch Yet, but it's my 'reward' for finishing papers and grading!

My question is this: What sort of stories and ideas were you (and the rest of the team) drawing from when creating What Remains of Edith Finch and the family members? I.E. What kinds of feelings and narratives were you drawn towards and pulling from during the creative process? I hope that makes sense!

Thank you so much, again! I hope you're both having a great day so far, and enjoying the well-deserved successful launch of your game.

That's a hard / long one. In the next couple months we'll go into a lot more detail on our company blog about the specific inspirations for the game, partly because I think players might find it interesting and partly because I want to encourage people to seek them out. The brief answer is that the core inspirations were One Hundred Years of Solitude, Lord Dunsany's Book of Wonder, and Bohemian Rhapsody.

Our next project will probably be focused on animation.

It's something I'm personally very interested in, and a lot of my favorite games (like Ico) and movies (Spirited Away) rely a lot on movement to say things that wouldn't sound the same in any other way.

My own plan is take some time off and take some animation courses to help develop my skills (and eyes) as an animator.

As to what that next game actually ends up looking like, who knows.

Congratulations on a brilliant game. (Just finished it)

One thing that struck me was, given the theme of the game, that it was never morose. Did it take many rewrites to get the tone right?

-   Report
    

Yes, it was really hard to know how players were going to respond to many of these stories. Also, we found that once we put the stories all together the response was very different than playing them separately. After you play a couple stories and you know that everyone is going to die by the end of them, you enter later stories with a lot more apprehension. Which worked out really well for us, since we didn't have to worry about setting the tone -- the context already handled so much of that -- and we could focus instead on shading in little, intimate details.

I just heard about the game and ive seen this great reviews but iam not sure if i should buy it so i ask it right away is it normal walking simulator or does the game has gameplay elements ?

-   Report
    

There are definitely gameplay elements involved with each of the stories that you'll experience, and they vary as well.

-   Report
    

It is definitely not a traditional "walking simulator" as people imagine. Although you do walk around the house as Edith, every step you take has meaning and context. You're never just walking looking for something to do. And as mentioned, every one of the stories are portrayed in different gameplay mechanics (which enhances the excitement of getting to a new story, because you have no way of telling what is going to be next)

Personally, I wish we saw more games like Everything ([http://www.everything-game.com/](http://www.everything-game.com/)) that are using games to expand the kinds of experiences we get to have and think about as humans, but as a developer I'm also kind of relieved that most other developers aren't interested in those spaces because it means there's such a large, undiscovered country out there for us to explore.

Hey Ian!! So glad you could do this AMA. A couple questions for you...

Can you recall any frustrating points in the development of What Remains of Edith Finch?

What do you think of other narrative games? Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls, Detroit (not released).

Without a constraint of time or resources what would you have done differently or expanded upon in What Remains of Edith Finch?

Thanks again :) Looking forward to playing it this week!

-   Report
    

Yes, I do recall some frustrating points during development. Nothing catastrophic though. We all learned from them and the game was better for it. Or at least that's how I've chosen to remember it.

I have a hard time getting into games that are primarily narrative driven. For me as a player, that's not what draws me into those worlds. I'm less interested in story per se than I am in the more visceral side of experience. I love that games like Everybody's Gone to the Rapture are forging a new path, and tackling problems like "how do we visually represent two people having an argument that doesn't feel silly" -- I myself would not have thought to using glowing balls of light, but I think it worked beautifully.

Without a constraint on time or resources What Remains of Edith Finch probably never would have come out. Or it would have been some strange, hopelessly delicate monstrosity like the Spruce Goose. All in all, I'm very happy with the way things turned out.

So I have a few questions for you So first in the E3 2015 demo video at 2:40 when it was showing the hallway it had 5 doors. The one at the end was Gregory’s door (1972-1973) the door direct left of Gregory’s is probably the twins room based on the blue and orange color scheme, and one right of the door was probably the parents’s room. So who were the people in the other 2 doors it’s not Barbara, Walter, or Molly based on the geography of the house? My 2nd question during the announcement trailer at 0:49-0:51 when it show the family tree it show the king on the left follow by Elizabeth and Matthew and their unknown child and then probably 3 unknown siblings to the right, So who were those other unknown siblings that Edith had, and was Edith real name supposed to be Elizabeth or now? My 3rd question is do you know where is the full gameplay of the E3 2015 demo cause it along with the house seem interesting as WROEF? My 4th question is during the GDC art direction video at 10:02 there was pictures that had the names Paul, and Samantha on them Paul was Calvin’s former name, but who was Samantha in general like brith and death years, how she is related to the family and etc, and at 18:16 there was another set of names that I saw but quickly recognize like Thomas, Anton, and Abigail were Lewis, Odin, and Ingeborg former names respectively, but who was Annika as well? My final question is we’re there any other characters for the old concept game the Nightmares of Edith Finch beside the ones stated in the concept like who was Edith’s grandparents, or parents, and just who were the 11 children of Bartholomew? That all my questions, and please answer them please?
