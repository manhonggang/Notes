## Part I

The tree of my title is not a green tree with leaves. It is the name of an abstract structure. I shall contrast it with another, more complex abstract structure called a semilattice. In order to relate these abstract structures to the nature of the city, I must first make a simple distinction.

I want to call those cities which have arisen more or less spontaneously over many, many years natural cities. And I shall call those cities and parts of cities which have been deliberately created by designers and planners artificial cities. Siena, Liverpool, Kyoto, Manhattan are examples of natural cities. Levittown, Chandigarh and the British New Towns are examples of artificial cities.

It is more and more widely recognized today that there is some essential ingredient missing from artificial cities. When compared with ancient cities that have acquired the patina of life, our modern attempts to create cities artificially are, from a human point of view, entirely unsuccessful.

Both the tree and the semilattice are ways of thinking about how a large collection of many small systems goes to make up a large and complex system. More generally, they are both names for structures of sets.

In order to define such structures, let me first define the concept of a set. A set is a collection of elements which for some reason we think of as belonging together. Since, as designers, we are concerned with the physical living city and its physical backbone, we must naturally restrict ourselves to considering sets which are collections of material elements such as people, blades of grass, cars, molecules, houses, gardens, water pipes, the water molecules in them etc. When the elements of a set belong together because they co-operate or work together somehow, we call the set of elements a system.

For example, in Berkeley at the corner of Hearst and Euclid, there is a drugstore, and outside the drugstore a traffic light. In the entrance to the drugstore there is a newsrack where the day's papers are displayed. When the light is red, people who are waiting to cross the street stand idly by the light; and since they have nothing to do, they look at the papers displayed on the newsrack which they can see from where they stand. Some of them just read the headlines, others actually buy a paper while they wait.

This effect makes the newsrack and the traffic light interactive; the newsrack, the newspapers on it, the money going from people's pockets to the dime slot, the people who stop at the light and read papers, the traffic light, the electric impulses which make the lights change, and the sidewalk which the people stand on form a system—they all work together. From the designer's point of view, the physically unchanging part of this system is of special interest. The newsrack, the traffic light and the sidewalk between them, related as they are, form the fixed part of the system. It is the unchanging receptacle in which the changing parts of the system—people, newspapers, money and electrical impulses—can work together. I define this fixed part as a unit of the city. It derives its coherence as a unit both from the forces which hold its own elements together and from the dynamic coherence of the larger living system which includes it as a fixed invariant part. Of the many, many fixed concrete subsets of the city which are the receptacles for its systems and can therefore be thought of as significant physical units, we usually single out a few for special consideration. In fact, I claim that whatever picture of the city someone has is defined precisely by the subsets he sees as units.

Now, a collection of subsets which goes to make up such a picture is not merely an amorphous collection. Automatically, merely because relationships are established among the subsets once the subsets are chosen, the collection has a definite structure.

To understand this structure, let us think abstractly for a moment, using numbers as symbols. Instead of talking about the real sets of millions of real particles which occur in the city, let us consider a simpler structure made of just half a dozen elements. Label these elements 1,2,3,4,5,6. Not including the full set [1,2,3,4,5,6], the empty set [-], and the one-element sets [1],[2],[3],C4],[5], [6], there are 56 different subsets we can pick from six elements.

Suppose we now pick out certain of these 56 sets (just as we pick out certain sets and call them units when we form our picture of the city). Let us say, for example, that we pick the following subsets: [123], [34], [45], [234], [345], [12345], [3456].

What are the possible relationships among these sets? Some sets will be entirely part of larger sets, as [34] is part of [345] and [3456]. Some of the sets will overlap, like [123] and [234]. Some of the sets will be disjoint—that is, contain no elements in common like [123] and [45].

We can see these relationships displayed in two ways. In diagram A each set chosen to be a unit has a line drawn round it. In diagram B the chosen sets are arranged in order of ascending magnitude, so that whenever one set contains another (as [345] contains [34], there is a vertical path leading from one to the other. For the sake of clarity and visual economy, it is usual to draw lines only between sets which have no further sets and lines between them; thus the line between [34] and [345] and the line between [345] and [3456] make it unnecessary to draw a line between [34] and [3456].

Diagrams A & B redrawn by Nikos Salingaros

As we see from these two representations, the choice of subsets alone endows the collection of subsets as a whole with an overall structure. This is the structure which we are concerned with here. When the structure meets certain conditions it is called a semilattice. When it meets other more restrictive conditions, it is called a tree.

The semilattice axiom goes like this: A collection of sets forms a semilattice if and only if, when two overlapping sets belong to the collection, the set of elements common to both also belongs to the collection.

The structure illustrated in diagrams A and B is a semilattice. It satisfies the axiom since, for instance, [234] and [345] both belong to the collection and their common part, [34], also belongs to it. (As far as the city is concerned, this axiom states merely that wherever two units overlap, the area of overlap is itself a recognizable entity and hence a unit also. In the case of the drugstore example, one unit consists of newsrack, sidewalk and traffic light. Another unit consists of the drugstore itself, with its entry and the newsrack. The two units overlap in the newsrack. Clearly this area of overlap is itself a recognizable unit and so satisfies the axiom above which defines the characteristics of a semilattice.) The tree axiom states: A collection of sets forms a tree if and only if, for any two sets that belong to the collection either one is wholly contained in the other, or else they are wholly disjoint.

The structure illustrated in diagrams C and D is a tree. Since this axiom excludes the possibility of overlapping sets, there is no way in which the semilattice axiom can be violated, so that every tree is a trivially simple semilattice.

Diagrams A & B redrawn by Nikos Salingaros

However, in this chapter we are not so much concerned with the fact that a tree happens to be a semilattice, but with the difference between trees and those more general semilattices which are not trees because they do contain overlapping units. We are concerned with the difference between structures in which no overlap occurs, and those structures in which overlap does occur.

It is not merely the overlap which makes the distinction between the two important. Still more important is the fact that the semilattice is potentially a much more complex and subtle structure than a tree. We may see just how much more complex a semilattice can be than a tree in the following fact: a tree based on 20 elements can contain at most 19 further subsets of the 20, while a semilattice based on the same 20 elements can contain more than 1,000,000 different subsets. This enormously greater variety is an index of the great structural complexity a semilattice can have when compared with the structural simplicity of a tree. It is this lack of structural complexity, characteristic of trees, which is crippling our conceptions of the city.

To demonstrate, let us look at some modern conceptions of the city, each of which I shall show to be essentially a tree.

## 第一部分

我标题中的树不是一棵绿叶树。它是一个抽象结构的名称。我将它与另一个更复杂的抽象结构——半格结构进行对比。为了将这些抽象结构与城市的本质联系起来，我必须先做一个简单的区分。

我想称那些在许多年内更或多或少地自然形成的城市为自然城市。我将称那些被设计师和规划者刻意创造的城市和城市部分为人工城市。锡耶纳、利物浦、京都、曼哈顿都是自然城市的例子。莱维敦、昌迪加尔和英国新城镇则是人工城市的例子。

今天越来越广泛地认识到，人工城市中缺少某种关键要素。从人类的角度来看，与已经获得生命光辉的古老城市相比，我们现代试图人造城市的尝试是完全不成功的。

树和半格结构都是思考一个由许多小系统组成的大而复杂的系统的方式。更一般地说，它们都是集合结构的名称。

为了定义这样的结构，让我先定义集合的概念。集合是一些元素的集合，我们认为它们因某种原因属于一起。由于作为设计师，我们关注的是实际的生活城市及其物理骨架，我们自然要限制自己考虑那些由物质元素组成的集合，例如人、草叶、汽车、分子、房屋、花园、水管、其中的水分子等等。当一个集合的元素之间因为相互合作或协同工作而属于一起时，我们称这些元素的集合为系统。

例如，在伯克利的赫斯特和欧克利德的街角，有一家药店，药店外面有一个红绿灯。在药店入口处有一个报刊架，上面展示当天的报纸。当红灯亮时，等待过马路的人们就在灯前无所事事地站着，因为他们没什么事可做，就看着新闻亭上展示的报纸。他们中的一些人只看标题，另一些人则在等待时真的买了一份报纸。

这种效果使新闻亭和红绿灯交互作用；新闻亭、上面的报纸、人们口袋里拿出的钱、停在红灯前看报的人、红绿灯、使灯光改变的电脉冲和人们站在上面的人行道形成了一个系统——它们都相互配合一起工作。从设计师的角度来看，这个系统的物理不变部分特别有趣。新闻亭、红绿灯和它们之间的人行道，因为它们的关系，形成了这个系统的固定部分。它是不变的容器，其中系统的可变部分——人、报纸、钱和电脉冲——可以一起工作。我将这个固定部分定义为城市的一个单位。它的内部元素之间的相互作用和包含它的更大的生命系统的动态一致性共同赋予了它作为一个单位的凝聚力。城市的许多固定具体子集都是其系统的容器，因此可以被认为是显著的物理单位。我们通常只挑选其中的一些进行特别考虑。实际上，我声称，任何人对城市的看法都是由他视为单位的子集所定义的。

现在，一个子集的集合并不仅仅是一个无形的集合。一旦选择了子集，自动地建立了子集之间的关系，集合就具有了明确的结构。

为了理解这种结构，让我们抽象地思考一下，使用数字作为符号。我们不再谈论城市中数百万个真实粒子的真实集合，而是考虑一个由六个元素组成的更简单的结构。将这些元素标记为1、2、3、4、5、6。不包括全集[1,2,3,4,5,6]、空集[-]和单元素集合[1]、[2]、[3]、[4]、[5]、[6]，我们可以从六个元素中选择56个不同的子集。

现在假设我们挑选出某些这56个集合中的子集（就像我们选择某些集合并将它们称为单位来构成城市的图像一样）。例如，我们选择以下子集：[123]、[34]、[45]、[234]、[345]、[12345]、[3456]。

这些集合之间可能有哪些关系？一些集合完全是更大集合的一部分，例如[34]是[345]和[3456]的一部分。一些集合会重叠，例如[123]和[234]。一些集合是不交的，即不包含共同元素，如[123]和[45]。

我们可以从图A中看到这些关系。每个被选为单位的集合都有一条线围绕着它。在图B中，所选集合按照升序排列，因此每当一个集合包含另一个集合（例如[345]包含[34]），就有一条垂直路径从一个集合通向另一个集合。为了清晰和简洁，通常只在没有其他集合的集合之间画线；因此，[34]和[345]之间的线和[345]和[3456]之间的线使得在[34]和[3456]之间画线变得不必要。

图A和B由Nikos Salingaros重新绘制

从这两个表示中可以看出，仅仅选择子集就使整个子集集合具有了总体结构。这就是我们在这里关心的结构。当这种结构满足特定条件时，它被称为半格结构。当它满足其他更严格的条件时，它被称为树形结构。

半格结构公理如下：如果一组集合形成半格，那么当两个重叠的集合属于该组集合时，两个集合共有的元素集合也属于该组集合。

图A和B所示的结构是半格结构。它满足该公理，因为例如[234]和[345]都属于该集合，它们的共同部分[34]也属于该集合。（就城市而言，该公理仅陈述了无论何处两个单位重叠，重叠的区域本身都是一个可识别的实体，因此也是一个单位。在药店的例子中，一个单位由新闻亭、人行道和红绿灯组成。另一个单位由药店本身、它的入口和新闻亭组成。两个单位在新闻亭重叠。显然，这个重叠区域本身就是一个可识别的单位，因此满足上面定义半格的公理。）树形结构公理如下：如果一组集合形成树，那么对于属于该集合的任意两个集合，其中一个完全包含在另一个集合中，或者它们完全不交。

图C和D所示的结构是树形结构。由于该公理排除了重叠集合的可能性，因此半格公理无法被违反，因此每棵树都是一个简单的半格结构。

图A和B由Nikos Salingaros重新绘制

然而，在本章中，我们关心的并不是树恰好是半格结构的事实，而是区分树和那些包含重叠单位的更一般的半格结构之间的差异。我们关心的是不重叠结构和重叠结构之间的差异。

这种区别之所以重要，不仅仅是因为重叠。更重要的是，半格结构潜在地比树形结构更复杂和微妙。我们可以从以下事实中看到半格结构比树形结构复杂得多：基于20个元素的树最多包含20个元素中的19个子集，而基于同样20个元素的半格结构可以包含超过1,000,000个不同的子集。这种巨大的多样性是半格结构与树形结构的结构简单性之间的巨大差异的指标。正是这种缺乏结构复杂性，是树的特点，使我们的城市观念受到了限制。

为了证明，让我们看一些现代城市的概念，每个概念我将证明它本质上都是树形结构。

Figure 3. Greater London plan (1943), Abercrombie and Forshaw: The drawing depicts the structure conceived by Abercrombie for London. It is made of a large number of communities, each sharply separated from all adjacent communities. Abercrombie writes, 'The proposal is to emphasize the identity of the existing communities, to increase their degree of segregation, and where necessary to recognize them as separate and definite entities.' And again, 'The communities themselves consist of a series of sub-units, generally with their own shops and schools, corresponding to the neighbourhood units.' The city is conceived as a tree with two principal levels. The communities are the larger units of the structure; the smaller sub-units are neighbourhoods. There are no overlapping units. The structure is a tree.

Figure 4. Mesa City, Paolo Soleri: The organic shapes of Mesa City lead us, at a careless glance, to believe that it is a richer structure than our more obviously rigid examples. But when we look at it in detail we find precisely the same principle of organization. Take, particularly, the university centre. Here we find the centre of the city divided into a university and a residential quarter, which is itself divided into a number of villages (actually apartment towers) for 4000 inhabitants, each again subdivided further and surrounded by groups of still smaller dwelling units.

图4. 帕奥罗·索莱里的梅萨城：梅萨城的有机形状让我们看起来以为它比我们更明显刚性的结构更加丰富。但是当我们仔细观察时，我们发现它确切地遵循着同样的组织原则。特别是，让我们看看大学中心。在这里，我们发现城市中心分为大学和居住区，后者又分为许多村庄（实际上是公寓大楼），可容纳4000居民，每个村庄再次进一步细分，并被一些更小的住宅单元所包围。

Figure 5. Tokyo plan, Kenzo Tange: This is a beautiful example. The plan consists of a series of loops stretched across Tokyo Bay. There are four major loops, each of which contains three medium loops. In the second major loop, one medium loop is the railway station and another is the port. Otherwise, each medium loop contains three minor loops which are residential neighbourhoods, except in the third major loop where one contains government offices and another industrial offices.

Figure 7. Brasilia, Lucio Costa: The entire form pivots about the central axis, and each of the two halves is served by a single main artery. This main artery is in turn fed by subsidiary arteries parallel to it. Finally, these are fed by the roads which surround the superblocks themselves. The structure is a tree.

Figure 8. Communitas, Percival and Paul Goodman: Communitas is explicitly organized as a tree: it is first divided into four concentric major zones, the innermost being a commercial centre, the next a university, the third residential and medical, and the fourth open country. Each of these is further subdivided: the commercial centre is represented as a great cylindrical skyscraper, containing five layers: airport, administration, light manufacture, shopping and amusement; and, at the bottom, railroads, buses and mechanical services. The university is divided into eight sectors comprising natural history, zoos and aquariums, planetarium, science laboratories, plastic arts, music and drama. The third concentric ring is divided into neighbourhoods of 4000 people each, not consisting of individual houses, but of apartment blocks, each of these containing individual dwelling units. Finally, the open country is divided into three segments: forest preserves, agriculture and vacation lands. The overall organization is a tree.

Figure 9.The most beautiful example of all I have kept until last, because it symbolizes the problem perfectly. It appears in Hilberseimer's book The Nature of Cities. He describes the fact that certain Roman towns had their origin as military camps, and then shows a picture of a modern military encampment as a kind of archetypal form for the city. It is not possible to have a structure which is a clearer tree. The symbol is apt, for, of course, the organization of the army was designed precisely in order to create discipline and rigidity. The photograph on the [left] is Hilberseimer's own scheme for the commercial area of a city based on the army camp archetype.

Each of these structures, then, is a tree. Each unit in each tree that I have described, moreover, is the fixed, unchanging residue of some system in the living city (just as a house is the residue of the interactions between the members of a family, their emotions and their belongings; and a freeway is the residue of movement and commercial exchange). However, in every city there are thousands, even millions, of times as many more systems at work whose physical residue does not appear as a unit in these tree structures. In the worst cases, the units which do appear fail to correspond to any living reality; and the real systems, whose existence actually makes the city live, have been provided with no physical receptacle.

Neither the Columbia plan nor the Stein plan for example, corresponds to social realities. The physical layout of the plans, and the way they function suggests a hierarchy of stronger and stronger closed social groups, ranging from the whole city down to the family, each formed by associational ties of different strength.

In a traditional society, if we ask a man to name his best friends and then ask each of these in turn to name their best friends, they will all name each other so that they form a closed group. A village is made up of a number of separate closed groups of this kind. But today's social structure is utterly different. If we ask a man to name his friends and then ask them in turn to name their friends, they will all name different people, very likely unknown to the first person; these people would again name others, and so on outwards. There are virtually no closed groups of people in modern society. The reality of today's social structure is thick with overlap—the systems of friends and acquaintances form a semilattice, not a tree (Figure 10).

In the natural city, even the house on a long street (not in some little cluster) is a more accurate acknowledgement of the fact that your friends live not next door, but far away, and can only be reached by bus or car. In this respect Manhattan has more overlap in it than Greenbelt. And though one can argue that in Greenbelt, too, friends are only minutes away by car, one must then ask: since certain groups have been emphasized by the physical units of the physical structure, why are just these the most irrelevant ones?

## Part II

The units of which an artificial city is made up are always organized to form a tree. So that we get a really clear understanding of what this means, and shall better see its implications, let us define a tree once again. Whenever we have a tree structure, it means that within this structure no piece of any unit is ever connected to other units, except through the medium of that unit as a whole.

The enormity of this restriction is difficult to grasp. It is a little as though the members of a family were not free to make friends outside the family, except when the family as a whole made a friendship.

In simplicity of structure the tree is comparable to the compulsive desire for neatness and order that insists the candlesticks on a mantelpiece be perfectly straight and perfectly symmetrical about the centre. The semilattice, by comparison, is the structure of a complex fabric; it is the structure of living things, of great paintings and symphonies. It must be emphasized, lest the orderly mind shrink in horror from anything that is not clearly articulated and categorized in tree form, that the idea of overlap, ambiguity, multiplicity of aspect and the semilattice are not less orderly than the rigid tree, but more so. They represent a thicker, tougher, more subtle and more complex view of structure. Let us now look at the ways in which the natural, when unconstrained by artificial conceptions, shows itself to be a semilattice.

A major aspect of the city's social structure which a tree can never mirror properly is illustrated by Ruth Glass's redevelopment plan for Middlesbrough, England, a city of 200,000 which she recommends be broken down into 29 separate neighbourhoods. After picking her 29 neighbourhoods by determining where the sharpest discontinuities of building type, income and job type occur, she asks herself the question: 'If we examine some of the social systems which actually exist for the people in such a neighbourhood, do the physical units defined by these various social systems all define the same spatial neighbourhood?' Her own answer to this question is no. Each of the social systems she examines is a nodal system. It is made of some sort of central node, plus the people who use this centre. Specifically she takes elementary schools, secondary schools, youth clubs, adult clubs, post offices, greengrocers and grocers selling sugar. Each of these centres draws its users from a certain spatial area or spatial unit. This spatial unit is the physical residue of the social system as a whole, and is therefore a unit in the terms of this discussion. The units corresponding to different kinds of centres for the single neighbourhood of Waterloo Road are shown in Figure 11.

The hard outline is the boundary of the so-called neighbourhood itself. The white circle stands for the youth club, and the small solid rings stand for areas where its members live. The ringed spot is the adult club, and the homes of its members form the unit marked by dashed boundaries. The white square is the post office, and the dotted line marks the unit which contains its users. The secondary school is marked by the spot with a white triangle in it. Together with its pupils, it forms the system marked by the dot-dashed line.

As you can see at once, the different units do not coincide. Yet neither are they disjoint. They overlap. We cannot get an adequate picture of what Middlesbrough is, or of what it ought to be, in terms of 29 large and conveniently integral Chunks called neighbourhoods. When we describe the city in terms of neighbourhoods, we implicitly assume that the smaller elements within any one of these neighbourhoods belong together so tightly that they only interact with elements in other neighbourhoods through the medium of the neighbourhoods to which they themselves belong. Ruth Glass herself shows clearly that this is not the case.

Next to Figure 11 are two representations of the Waterloo neighbourhood. For the sake of argument I have broken it into a number of small areas. Figure 12 shows how these pieces stick together in fact, and Figure 13 shows how the redevelopment plan pretends they stick together.

There is nothing in the nature of the various centres which says that their catchment areas should be the same. Their natures are different. Therefore the units they define are different. The natural city of Middlesbrough was faithful to the semilattice structure of the units. Only in the artificial-tree conception of the city are their natural, proper and necessary overlaps destroyed.

Consider the separation of pedestrians from moving vehicles, a tree concept proposed by Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn and many others. At a very crude level of thought this is obviously a good idea. Yet the urban taxi can function only because pedestrians and vehicles are not strictly separated. The cruising taxi needs a fast stream of traffic so that it can cover a large area to be sure of finding a passenger. The pedestrian needs to be able to hail the taxi from any point in the pedestrian world, and to be able to get out to any part of the pedestrian world to which he wants to go. The system which contains the taxicabs needs to overlap both the fast vehicular traffic system and the system of pedestrian circulation. In Manhattan pedestrians and vehicles do share certain parts of the city, and the necessary overlap is guaranteed (Figure 14).

Another favourite concept of the CIAM theorists and others is the separation of recreation from everything else. This has crystallized in our real cities in the form of playgrounds. The playground, asphalted and fenced in, is nothing but a pictorial acknowledgment of the fact that 'play' exists as an isolated concept in our minds. It has nothing to do with the life of play itself. Few self-respecting children will even play in a playground.

Play itself, the play that children practise, goes on somewhere different every day. One day it may be indoors, another day in a friendly gas station, another day down by the river, another day in a derelict building, another day on a construction site which has been abandoned for the weekend. Each of these play activities, and the objects it requires, forms a system. It is not true that these systems exist in isolation, cut off from the other systems of the city. The different systems overlap one another, and they overlap many other systems besides. The units, the physical places recognized as play places, must do the same.

In a natural city this is what happens. Play takes place in a thousand places it fills the interstices of adult life. As they play, children become full of their surroundings. How can children become filled with their surroundings in a fenced enclosure! They cannot.

A similar kind of mistake occurs in trees like that of Goodman's Communitas or Soleri's Mesa City, which separate the university from the rest of the city. Again, this has actually been realized in the common American form of the isolated campus.

What is the reason for drawing a line in the city so that everything within the boundary is university, and everything outside is nonuniversity? It is conceptually clear. But does it correspond to the realities of university life? Certainly it is not the structure which occurs in nonartificial university cities.

There are always many systems of activity where university life and city life overlap: pub-crawling, coffee-drinking, the movies, walking from place to place. In some cases whole departments may be actively involved in the life of the city's inhabitants (the hospital-cum-medical school is an example). In Cambridge, a natural city where university and city have grown together gradually, the physical units overlap because they are the physical residues of city systems and university systems which overlap (Figure 15).

Let us look next at the hierarchy of urban cores realized in Brasilia, Chandigarh, the MARS plan for London and, most recently, in the Manhattan Lincoln Center, where various performing arts serving the population of greater New York have been gathered together to form just one core.

Does a concert hall ask to be next to an opera house? Can the two feed on one another? Will anybody ever visit them both, gluttonously, in a single evening, or even buy tickets from one after going to a performance in the other? In Vienna, London, Paris, each of the performing arts has found its own place, because all are not mixed randomly. Each has created its own familiar section of the city. In Manhattan itself, Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera House were not built side by side. Each found its own place, and now creates its own atmosphere. The influence of each overlaps the parts of the city which have been made unique to it.

The only reason that these functions have all been brought together in Lincoln Center is that the concept of performing art links them to one another.

But this tree, and the idea of a single hierarchy of urban cores which is its parent, do not illuminate the relations between art and city life. They are merely born of the mania every simple-minded person has for putting things with the same name into the same basket.

The total separation of work from housing, started by Tony Garnier in his industrial city, then incorporated in the 1929 Athens Charter, is now found in every artificial city and accepted everywhere where zoning is enforced. Is this a sound principle? It is easy to see how bad conditions at the beginning of the century prompted planners to try to get the dirty factories out of residential areas. But the separation misses a variety of systems which require, for their sustenance, little parts of both.

Finally, let us examine the subdivision of the city into isolated communities. As we have seen in the Abercrombie plan for London, this is itself a tree structure. The individual community in a greater city has no reality as a functioning unit. In London, as in any great city, almost no one manages to find work which suits him near his home. People in one community work in a factory which is very likely to be in another community.

There are therefore many hundreds of thousands of worker-workplace systems, each consisting of individuals plus the factory they work in, which cut across the boundaries defined by Abercrombie's tree. The existence of these units, and their overlapping nature, indicates that the living systems of London form a semilattice. Only in the planner's mind has it become a tree.

The fact that we have so far failed to give this any physical expression has a vital consequence. As things are, whenever the worker and his workplace belong to separately administered municipalities, the community which contains the workplace collects huge taxes and has relatively little on which to spend the tax revenue. The community where the worker lives, if it is mainly residential, collects only little in the way of taxes and yet has great additional burdens on its purse in the form of schools, hospitals, etc. Clearly, to resolve this inequity, the worker-workplace systems must be anchored in physically recognizable units of the city which can then be taxed.

It might be argued that, even though the individual communities of a great city have no functional significance in the lives of their inhabitants, they are still the most convenient administrative units, and should therefore be left in their present tree organization. However, in the political complexity of a modern city, even this is suspect.

Edward Banfield, in his book Political Influence, gives a detailed account of the patterns of influence and control that have actually led to decisions in Chicago. He shows that, although the lines of administrative and executive control have a formal structure which is a tree, these formal chains of influence and authority are entirely overshadowed by the ad hoc lines of control which arise naturally as each new city problem presents itself. These ad hoc lines depend on who is interested in the matter, who has what at stake, who has what favours to trade with whom.

This second structure, which is informal, working within the framework of the first, is what really controls public action. It varies from week to week, even from hour to hour, as one problem replaces another. Nobody's sphere of influence is entirely under the control of any one superior; each person is under different influences as the problems change. Although the organization chart in the Mayor's office is a tree, the actual control and exercise of authority is semilattice-like. Now, why is it that so many designers have conceived cities as trees when the natural structure is in every case a semilattice? Have they done so deliberately, in the belief that a tree structure will serve the people of the city better? Or have they done it because they cannot help it, because they are trapped by a mental habit, perhaps even trapped by the way the mind works—because they cannot encompass the complexity of a semilattice in any convenient mental form, because the mind has an overwhelming predisposition to see trees wherever it looks and cannot escape the tree conception? I shall try to convince you that it is for this second reason that trees are being proposed and built as cities—that is, because designers, limited as they must be by the capacity of the mind to form intuitively accessible structures, cannot achieve the complexity of the semilattice in a single mental act.

Let me begin with an example. Suppose I ask you to remember the following four objects: an orange, a watermelon, a football and a tennis ball. How will you keep them in your mind, in your mind's eye? However you do it, you will do it by grouping them. Some of you will take the two fruits together, the orange and the watermelon, and the two sports balls together, the football and the tennis ball. Those of you who tend to think in terms of physical shape may group them differently, taking the two small spheres together—the orange and the tennis ball and the two large and more egg-shaped objects—the watermelon and the football. Some of you will be aware of both.

Let us make a diagram of these groupings (Figure 16). Either grouping taken by itself is a tree structure. The two together are a semilattice. Now let us try and visualize these groupings in the mind's eye. I think you will find that you cannot visualize all four sets simultaneously—because they overlap. You can visualize one pair of sets and then the other, and you can alternate between the two pairs extremely fast, so that you may deceive yourself into thinking you can visualize them all together. But in truth, you cannot conceive all four sets at once in a single mental act. You cannot bring the semilattice structure into a visualizable form for a single mental act. In a single mental act you can only visualize a tree.

This is the problem we face as designers. While we are not, perhaps, necessarily occupied with the problem of total visualization in a single mental act, the principle is still the same. The tree is accessible mentally and easy to deal with. The semilattice is hard to keep before the mind's eye and therefore hard to deal with.

It is known today that grouping and categorization are among the most primitive psychological processes. Modern psychology treats thought as a process of fitting new situations into existing slots and pigeonholes in the mind. Just as you cannot put a physical thing into more than one physical pigeonhole at once, so, by analogy, the processes of thought prevent you from putting a mental construct into more than one mental category at once. Study of the origin of these processes suggests that they stem essentially from the organism's need to reduce the complexity of its environment by establishing barriers between the different events that it encounters.

It is for this reason—because the mind's first function is to reduce the ambiguity and overlap in a confusing situation and because, to this end, it is endowed with a basic intolerance for ambiguity—that structures like the city, which do require overlapping sets within them, are nevertheless persistently conceived as trees.

The same rigidity dogs even perception of physical patterns. In experiments by Huggins and myself at Harvard, we showed people patterns whose internal units overlapped, and found that they almost always invent a way of seeing the patterns as a tree—even when the semilattice view of the patterns would have helped them perform the task of experimentation which was before them.

The most startling proof that people tend to conceive even physical patterns as trees is found in some experiments of Sir Frederick Bartlett. He showed people a pattern for about a quarter of a second and then asked them to draw what they had seen. Many people, unable to grasp the full complexity of the pattern they had seen, simplified the patterns by cutting out the overlap. In Figure 17, the original is shown on the left, with two fairly typical redrawn versions to the right of it. In the redrawn versions the circles are separated from the rest; the overlap between triangles and circles disappears.

These experiments suggest strongly that people have an underlying tendency, when faced by a complex organization, to reorganize it mentally in terms of non-overlapping units. The complexity of the semilattice is replaced by the simpler and more easily grasped tree form.

You are no doubt wondering by now what a city looks like which is a semilattice, but not a tree. I must confess that I cannot yet show you plans or sketches. It is not enough merely to make a demonstration of overlap—the overlap must be the right overlap. This is doubly important because it is so tempting to make plans in which overlap occurs for its own sake. This is essentially what the high- density 'life-filled' city plans of recent years do. But overlap alone does not give structure. It can also give chaos. A garbage can is full of overlap. To have structure, you must have the right overlap, and this is for us almost certainly different from the old overlap which we observe in historic cities. As the relationships between functions change, so the systems which need to overlap in order to receive these relationships must also change. The recreation of old kinds of overlap will be inappropriate, and chaotic instead of structured.

One can perhaps make the physical consequences of overlap more comprehensible by means of an image. The painting illustrated is a work by Simon Nicholson (Figure 18). The fascination of this painting lies in the fact that, although constructed of rather few simple triangular elements, these elements unite in many different ways to form the large units of the painting—in such a way indeed that, if we make a complete inventory of the perceived units in the painting, we find that each triangle enters into four or five completely different kinds of unit, none contained in the others, yet all overlapping in that triangle.

Thus, if we number the triangles and pick out the sets of triangles which appear as strong visual units, we get the semilattice shown inFigure 19. Three and 5 form a unit because they work together as a rectangle; 2 and 4 because they form a parallelogram; 5 and 6 because they are both dark and pointing the same way; 6 and 7 because one is the ghost of the other shifted sideways; 4 and 7 because they are symmetrical with one another; 4 and 6 because they form another rectangle; 4 and 5 because they form a sort of Z; 2 and 3 because they form a rather thinner kind of Z; 1 and 7 because they are at opposite corners; 1 and 2 because they are a rectangle; 3 and 4 because they point the same way as 5 and 6, and form a sort of off-centre reflection; 3 and 6 because they enclose 4 and 5; 1 and S because they enclose 2, 3 and 4. I have only listed the units of two triangles. The larger units are even more complex. The white is more complex still and is not even included in the diagram because it is harder to be sure of its elementary pieces.

The painting is significant, not so much because it has overlap in it (many paintings have overlap in them), but rather because this painting has nothing else in it except overlap. It is only the fact of the overlap, and the resulting multiplicity of aspects which the forms present, that makes the painting fascinating. It seems almost as though the painter had made an explicit attempt, as I have done, to single out overlap as a vital generator of structure.

All the artificial cities I have described have the structure of a tree rather than the semilattice structure of the Nicholson painting. Yet it is the painting, and other images like it, which must be our vehicles for thought. And when we wish to be precise, the semilattice, being part of a large branch of modern mathematics, is a powerful way of exploring the structure of these images. It is the semilattice we must look for, not the tree.

When we think in terms of trees we are trading the humanity and richness of the living city for a conceptual simplicity which benefits only designers, planners, administrators and developers. Every time a piece of a city is torn out, and a tree made to replace the semilattice that was there before, the city takes a further step toward dissociation.

In any organized object, extreme compartmentalization and the dissociation of internal elements are the first signs of coming destruction. In a society, dissociation is anarchy. In a Person, dissociation is the mark of schizophrenia and impending suicide. An ominous example of city-wide dissociation is the separation of retired people from the rest of urban life, caused by the growth of desert cities for the old like Sun City, Arizona. This separation is only possible under the influence of treelike thought.

It not only takes from the young the company of those who have lived long, but worse, it causes the same rift inside each individual life. As you pass into Sun City, and into old age, your ties with your own past will be unacknowledged, lost and therefore broken. Your youth will no longer be alive in your old age—the two will be dissociated; your own life will be cut in two.

For the human mind, the tree is the easiest vehicle for complex thoughts. But the city is not, cannot and must not be a tree. The city is a receptacle for life. If the receptacle severs the overlap of the strands of life within it, because it is a tree, it will be like a bowl full of razor blades on edge, ready to cut up whatever is entrusted to it. In such a receptacle life will be cut to pieces. If we make cities which are trees, they will cut our life within to pieces.

第八图，Communitas、Percival和Paul Goodman：Communitas明确地组织为一棵树：首先被分成四个同心大区，最内层是商业中心，接下来是大学，第三是住宅和医疗，第四是开放乡村。每个区域都进一步细分：商业中心被表示为一个巨大的圆柱形摩天大楼，包含五个层次：机场、行政、轻工业、购物和娱乐；在底部是铁路、公共汽车和机械服务。大学分为八个部门，包括自然历史、动物园和水族馆、天文馆、科学实验室、塑料艺术、音乐和戏剧。第三个同心圆被划分为每个4000人的社区，不是由单独的房屋组成，而是由公寓楼组成，每个公寓楼都包含单独的住宅单元。最后，开放的乡村被划分为三个部分：森林保护区、农业和度假胜地。总体组织形式是一棵树。

第九图是我保留的最美的例子，因为它完美地象征了这个问题。它出现在Hilberseimer的书《城市的本质》中。他描述了某些罗马城镇的起源是军营，然后展示了一张现代军营的照片，作为城市的原型形式。没有一种结构比这更清晰的树形结构了。这个符号是适当的，因为当然，军队的组织正是为了创造纪律和严密性。左边的照片是Hilberseimer自己基于军营原型的商业区域的方案。

因此，我描述的每棵树中的每个单元都是城市中某些系统的固定、不变残留物（就像房子是家庭成员、情感和物品之间互动的残留物一样；高速公路是运动和商业交流的残留物）。但是，在每个城市中，还有成千上万甚至数百万个更多的系统在运作，它们的物理残留物不会出现在这些树形结构的单元中。在最糟糕的情况下，出现的单元未能对应任何生活现实；而使城市活着的真正系统未被提供任何物理容器。

例如，哥伦比亚计划和斯坦计划并不符合社会现实。计划的物理布局和运作方式表明存在一种越来越强的封闭社交群体的等级制度，范围从整个城市到家庭，每个群体由不同强度的联合联系组成。

在传统社会中，如果我们要求一个人列出他最好的朋友，然后依次要求每个人列出他们最好的朋友，他们都会彼此列出，形成一个封闭的群体。一个村庄由许多这样的封闭群体组成。但是，今天的社会结构完全不同。如果我们要求一个人列出他的朋友，然后依次要求他们列出他们的朋友，他们都会列出不同的人，很可能第一个人不认识其中的任何一个人；这些人再次列出其他人，以此类推。现代社会几乎没有封闭的人群。今天社会结构的现实充满了重叠——朋友和熟人的系统形成了一个半格，而不是一棵树（图10）。

在自然城市中，即使是长街上的房子（而不是一些小集群中的房子），也更准确地承认了您的朋友不住在隔壁，而是住得很远，只能乘公共汽车或汽车到达。在这方面，曼哈顿的重叠比Greenbelt更多。尽管可以争论说在Greenbelt中，朋友只需几分钟就可以开车到达，但随之而来的问题是：由于物理结构的物理单元已强调了某些群体，为什么只有这些群体是最不相关的？

第二部分

构成人工城市的单元总是有组织成树状结构。为了让我们真正清楚地了解这意味着什么，并更好地看到其含义，让我们再次定义一棵树。每当我们有一个树形结构时，就意味着在这个结构内，任何单元的任何部分都不会与其他单元连接，除非通过该单元作为一个整体的媒介。

这种限制的巨大程度很难理解。这有点像如果家庭成员无法自由地与家庭外的人交朋友，除非整个家庭交朋友。

在树的简单性方面，与强迫症的渴望一样，它坚持蜡烛台上的烛台必须完全笔直，关于中心完全对称。相比之下，半格是复杂织物的结构；它是生命的结构，伟大的绘画和交响乐的结构。必须强调的是，重叠、模糊、多方面和半格的想法不比严格的树形结构不整齐，而是更加有条理。它们代表了更厚实、更坚韧、更微妙和更复杂的结构观点。现在让我们看看自然时如何展现出半格结构。

城市社会结构的一个重要方面，在树中永远无法正确地反映，这由Ruth Glass为英国米德尔斯堡市的重建计划所示，该城市有20万人口，她建议将其分成29个单独的社区。在确定建筑类型、收入和工作类型最不连续的位置后，她问自己一个问题：“如果我们检查某些实际存在于这样的社区中的人们的社会系统，这些不同的社会系统定义的物理单元是否都定义了相同的空间社区？”她自己的答案是否定的。她检查的每个社会系统都是一个节点系统。它由某种中央节点以及使用该中心的人组成。具体而言，她采取了小学、中学、青年俱乐部、成人俱乐部、邮局、蔬菜水果店和卖糖的杂货店。每个中心都从一定的空间区域或空间单元中吸引其用户。此空间单元是整个社会系统的物理残留物，因此在本讨论中是一个单位。对于华特路的单个社区，对应于不同种类的中心的单位如图11所示。

硬轮廓是所谓的社区的边界。白色圆圈代表青年俱乐部，小实心圆圈代表其成员居住的区域。有环标记的点是成人俱乐部，其成员的住所形成由虚线界定的单位。白色正方形是邮局，虚线标记了包含其用户的单位。中学是用白色三角形标记的。与其学生一起，它形成由点虚线标记的系统。

正如您一眼看到的那样，不同的单元不重合。然而，它们也不是不相交的。它们重叠。我们无法对Middlesbrough是什么或应该成为什么的图像进行充分的描述，因为它们自然地重叠，而不是通过它们自己所属的社区来与其他社区中的元素互动。Ruth Glass本人清楚地表明这不是事实。

在图11旁边是Waterloo社区的两个表示。为了讨论，我将其分成许多小区域。图12显示了这些部分实际上如何粘在一起，图13显示了改造计划如何假装它们粘在一起。

没有一种中心的存在表明它们的接收范围应该是相同的。它们的本质不同。因此，它们定义的单位是不同的。米德尔斯堡的自然城市忠实于单位的半格结构。只有在城市的人工树形概念中，它们自然的、适当的和必要的重叠被破坏了。

考虑步行者与行驶车辆的分离，这是Le Corbusier、Louis Kahn和许多其他人提出的树形概念。在非常粗略的思考水平上，这显然是一个好主意。但是，城市出租车只能在行人和车辆不严格分离的情况下运行。巡游出租车需要快速的交通流以便能够覆盖较大的区域，以确保找到乘客。行人需要能够从行人世界的任何地方招手出租车，并能够到达他想去的任何行人世界的部分。包含出租车的系统需要同时重叠快速车辆流系统和行人流系统。在曼哈顿，行人和车辆确实分享了城市的某些部分，并保证了必要的重叠（图14）。

许多CIAM理论家和其他人最喜欢的概念之一是将娱乐与其他一切隔离开来。这在我们真实的城市中以游乐场的形式凝结出来。这个人行道上的游乐场是一种图像上的承认，即“游戏”作为一个孤立的概念存在于我们的头脑中。它与玩的生活无关。几乎没有自尊心的孩子会在游乐场上玩耍。

孩子玩耍的本身，孩子实践的游戏，每天都在不同的地方进行。一天可能在室内，另一天在友好的加油站，另一天在河边，另一天在废弃的建筑物中，
