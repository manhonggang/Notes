3\. User Research without a Prototype
-------------------------------------

You can conduct user research by using these strategies.

Email

Open rates, click through rates, and task completion rates for recipients all provide insight into whether your idea has value.

Landing Pages

You can build a landing page to complement your advertising. The landing page can be your proof of concept and allow you to test click through rates on buttons such as “buy now”, “register” or “share”. The clicks serve as further validation of the idea.

Buttons

Add buttons for specific features or services that your business will provide. Even if the buttons aren’t functional, you can measure interest and collect emails or other demographics on users. If a design element (such as a button) doesn't actually work on your website, be sure to indicate that to users and explain to users why it isn’t working.

4\. User Engagement

5\. Market Demands and Trends Analysis
--------------------------------------

You are trying to answer the question, "What’s currently going on in the world?".

1.  Keyword Evaluation (Google AdWords) What are people searching for? What do you notice after filtering the high volume keywords?
2.  Content Competition (Google Search) What type of content appears in your searches? (articles or companies) Is this consistent for other keyword searches related to your idea?
3.  Geographic Validation (Google Trends) Where do people live who are searching for related keywords? What barriers might exist to deliver the product or service?
4.  Social Media Validation (Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest) What volume of people use keywords related to your idea? How are users talking about related ideas? Handy for communicating your idea and for marketing materials later.
