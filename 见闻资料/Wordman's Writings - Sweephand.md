Don’t let this get around to the outside.”  
   — Van Halen

While celebrating Christmas over margaritas in the Forum Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas, my uncle laughed at the speech of the dancing statue of Bacchus in front of us, saying “This is the most honest town in the world.” I had to agree; Las Vegas makes no pretense about what it is. It is no secret that casinos, given half the chance, will take your money. That is a fact of gambling, a fact which, while obviously not flaunted by casinos, is neither denied nor hushed up. Even so, certain Las Vegas casinos work in a very subtle way to separate you from your money, most notably through their use of internal space.

Caesars Palace and the Mirage, two neighboring hotel/casinos on the Las Vegas Strip have been internally (and, to a lesser extent, externally) designed almost solely for the purpose of increasing profits. The casino layout, lighting and access manipulate gamblers in an almost unnoticeable way specifically designed to keep them within the casino and to keep them gambling.

## Bad Obsession

In order to understand the execution of such a manipulative design, something must be said about its motivation, which in this case is making money by providing gambling services. To fully appreciate how this is done, a little must be said about the economics of gambling. From the player’s point of view, making money gambling is a matter of luck, skill and strategy. From the casino’s standpoint, however, none of these factors are relevant; all that matters is volume. Gambling works because the games are set up in such a way that both the player and the casino can reasonably and logically expect to keep these outlooks.

For any given bet a player might make, he or she has a realistic chance of winning that bet. For example, a bet on the pass line at a craps table\* has an almost fifty-fifty chance of paying off. The key to all of Las Vegas is that word “almost”. The game of craps is organized so that for any given bet, the odds of the player losing are slightly greater that the odds of the player winning. The margin between the two is called the house advantage. The pass line at craps has one of the smallest house advantages of any bet in Las Vegas: 1.4%. One way of looking at this is that, after 1,000 pass bets are made, the house will have won, on average, 14 more bets than it lost. After 10,000 pass bets are made, the house will have won 140 more than it has lost, on average.

This basic premise is what makes Las Vegas work. It allows a player a real chance to win money while simultaneously allowing a casino to consistently make money. For the player, his chances of winning remain constant. For the casino, however, they only make money consistently on one condition: lots of bets are made.

As shown above, more bets made gives more bets won by the casino, on average, and therefore the more money made. A risk for the casino, however, is that since each bet has no effect on the bets that precede or follow in terms of outcome, it is possible that the actual results on any given day will not be “average”. Some days they might do better, some days, they might do worse and even lose money. The statistical chance of this happening, however, grows vanishingly small as the number of bet increases, so the more bets that are made, the greater the likelihood that the “average” scenario will actually be the case.

This leads directly to the casinos most profitable business strategy: run the casino in such a way that leads to the most bets possible. They can do this in two ways: attract more and more gamblers, and see to it that the gamblers, once inside, stay gambling for longer periods of time. The two casinos investigated in this paper actively pursue both tactics, but apart from giving free alcohol to gamblers, other casinos mostly ignore the latter, concentrating instead on enticing customers inside. This is done in many ways, but, as this is an architecture paper (all evidence to the contrary aside), only the way in which architecture accomplishes this task will be discussed here.

## Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door

Although this paper is mainly interested in the workings of the internal casino space, enticing passer-by to enter is largely (if not solely) a function of the exterior of a casino. Las Vegas being Las Vegas, however, “standard” architectural forms are somewhat unhelpful. Take this description of Caesars Palace, for example:

> The front colonnade is San Pietro-Bernini in plan but Yamasaki in vocabulary and scale; the blue and gold mosaic work is Early Christian tomb of Galla Placidia. Beyond and above is a slab in Gio Ponti Pirelli-Barouque, and beyond that, in turn, a low wing in Neo-classical Motel Moderne. … Within the Piazza San Pietro is the token parking lot. Among the parked cars rise five fountains rather than the two of Carlo Maderno; Villa d’Este cypresses further punctuate the parking environment. Gian de Bologna’s Rape of the Sabine Women and statues of Venus and David, with slight anatomical exaggerations, grace the area around the porte cochere. Almost bisecting Venus is an Avis, as sign identifying No. 2’s offices on the premises. (Venturi, et. al., pg 51.)

Analyzing such a structure in the same way as you might analyze a real Roman temple would be a nightmare. Fortunately, in Learning From Las Vegas, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown offer a different way of looking as such a building as a part of a complex order of the strip as a whole, as part of an emerging method of embodying commercial enterprise. Frederic Jameson—in an all-to-rare moment when he was not quoting Hegel or a multitude of other thinkers—perhaps summed up this view when he said that the designers of such buildings…

> …no longer attempt, as did the masterworks and monuments of high modernism, to insert a different, a distinct, an elevated, a new Utopian language into the tawdry and commercial sign system of the surrounding city, but rather they seek to speak that very language, using its lexicon and syntax as that has been emblematically “learned from Las Vegas.” (Jameson, pg 39)

Or, in other words, Caesars excites us because it is an embodiment of what we find exciting about Las Vegas. It is an embodiment of the commercialization of luck, of the Las Vegas experience.

I think this is crap.

Well, perhaps not entirely. Although it seems lofty, overly academic, and generally expressed in writing rife with intellectual masturbation, the idea that Caesars is Las Vegas and vice versa is at least reasonable. We are pulled into a casino as we are pulled into any other place of commerce, as if it were any other store, in this case one that sold the Las Vegas Experience. The oversized sign does grab our eye from afar and holds our attention until we enter, just as Venturi suggested, but the architecture of places like Caesars Palace and the Mirage is a bit more powerful, a bit more actively engaging than that. Venturi and his ilk seem to place lots of relevance on the exteriors of Strip casinos; however, they are interested in them as a model for commercial strips worldwide. Although this is a persuasive tactic and is helpful in understanding commercial strips, to place the Strip in with other commercial strips is to misunderstand casinos. Absent from their analysis (and, in many ways irrelevant to it) is the way in which a specific building might operate on the public, with its own agenda.

Both Caesars Palace and the Mirage, for example, have architecture so stunningly odd, even taken out of the Las Vegas context (or, perhaps, especially then), that one cannot help but wonder what is inside. The large, black techno-sphere of the OmniMax™ theater of Caesars Palace somehow manages to integrate itself with the bizarre Romanesque of the rest of the building. It speaks pure decadence, which almost requires investigation. The Mirage, on the other hand, compares to nowhere else on Earth, with its sleek golden-glasses tri-spoked tower and (need I even mention) the volcano exploding every 15 minutes from the lake which is the front lawn (see Plate 2). We all know it’s a gimmick, but ignoring its lure, once in front of it, is a superhuman undertaking. The pure physical impact of the two casinos from the outside make it nearly impossible to pass either place without entering.

In addition, both use an almost blatant method of enticing customers in through architecture: conveyor belts. In the days since Learning From Las Vegas, the car has become not only unnecessary to a Las Vegas vacationer, but actually undesirable. Where, as Venturi points out, the Strip and it’s hotels were once designed around the car, foot traffic now reigns. (Newer hotels, like the Excalibur have parking lots so far away from them that the use trams to cart in guests from the parking lot to the hotel.) Additions were made to Caesars Palace which cater to foot traffic, mainly the addition and integration of three “people movers”, conveyor belts which bring customers from the street down the long distance to the hotel previously traveled by car. The Mirage has an almost identical system. In both cases, the journey down the movers is accompanied by a friendly recorded voice lauding the features of its respective hotel. Naturally, this voice can be heard near the street entrance to the movers, attracting even more people. Also, the movers are covered, offering shade from the Las Vegas sun. While this last doesn’t sound all that significant, a typical summer day in Las Vegas can easily break 100 degrees, and the intense heat is much easier to ignore by someone sitting inside a building in New England reading papers than by someone in front of a shady doorway, inviting him or her within.

## (Lost in the) Garden of Eden

It is inside the casino that architecture begins to play its most crucial role, especially in the case of Caesars Palace and the Mirage. The internal space of these two casinos functions with a simple premise in mind: to keep customers within it. The execution of such an idea is extremely subtle; it is not so much that people are prevented from leaving but simply not encouraged to do so. Rather aggressively not encouraged. This is perhaps best illustrated by Caesars Palace, where the layout of the public spaces within have the effect of confusing those within it.

Although not an official plan of the Palace, Map 1 gives a sense of organizational layout sufficient to illustrate this purpose. Where many hotels have just one casino, Caesars has two or three spread throughout its ground floor. From the map, it can be seen that there are at least three different ways to get from one of these casinos to the other, all without leaving the building. You can (and very often do) go through one “corridor” and return through another, often unaware you are back where you came from. Note on the map the somewhat arbitrary way the sections C-F are divided, with, for example, the Olympic Casino spanning two sections. Few landmarks can be found within the rather vast casino areas; note how each casino has a Megabucks Slots area near an entrance (C-4 and E-9), each of which are adorned with the same sign.

The map also shows the oddly curved walls and rooms that seem to jut out for no apparent reason (C-2, E-16, D-3, F-1, etc.). These serve to jumble the internal landscape, slowly warping your sense of direction. The oddly organic shapes of these walls provide a false anchor, as you can look at one to get your bearings, look away, and when you look back, be uncertain as to weather you were looking at that curve, or the one next to it. There are no windows. All light is created, providing no means of gauging direction by where light is coming from.

Exits in this environment are extremely hard to spot. In keeping with fire codes, they are all marked by lit “exit” signs, but in an environment where neon, flashing lights and sirens is the norm, this is hardly helpful. Retracing your steps (assuming you even can, which is not likely) often doesn’t help, as some doors to the outside function only as entrances, not exits, in particular the people mover leading to section F on the map. And in perhaps the least subtle of all the ways you are encouraged not to leave, the people movers which pull you in do only that; there are no people movers that go the opposite direction, taking you back out to the street.

This same method of controlling exits is used with the Forum Shops connected to Caesars (see F-4, as well as Map 2), a standard up-scale shopping mall. A people mover takes you into the mall’s entrance, but the only way to leave the mall is through the casino inside Caesars. It is also no accident that getting to the exit entails walking down a winding central artery, passing every store inside the mall. This system not only manipulates a visitor into spending some time in the casino (at which point the internal space of the casino can work its magic) but allowing all the stores to pull him or her in as well.

What cannot be seen on the map of Caesars is the layout of the tables and slot machines. Taken alone, the spaces of the casinos might seem rather easy to grab hold of visually, however, the tables and machines are arranged in such a way that passing through the casino requires winding through and around them. To this, add a few more facts: the slots are tall enough to block your line of sight, the casino is jammed with people, there are flashing lights everywhere, when you walk through a casino your often pay more attention to the gambling excitement around you than on where you are going. All of these facts are common in any casino, but when combined with an internal spatial layout that is fully aware of such facts and works in a way to enhance their distracting power, like the layout of Caesars Palace, the effect is often the distraction of those within such a space, and the postponement of rational thought by them. The end result: they take longer to get out of the damn place than they would have otherwise, often much longer.

## Coma

Other elements of the inside of Caesars enhance this confusing quality, disassociating time and space. Although not strictly speaking designed space, within the confines and influence of Caesars, the elements of clocks and lighting act as architectural elements, forming a key part of the intent of the internal space.

A casino has no clocks.

By implication, casinos have no time either, they are always open, a sort of perpetual twilight. This is accentuated by the lighting of casinos. They are very dark. This both enhances the attraction and distraction of the flashing lights, as well as hide the borders of the room you are in. As Venturi and Brown say in the one page in which they discuss Las Vegas interiors…

> the combination of darkness and enclosure of the gambling room and its subspaces makes for privacy, protection, concentration and control. The intricate maze under the low ceiling never connects with the outside light or outside space. This disorients the outside light or outside space. This disorients the occupant in space and time. one loses track of where one is an when it is. Time is limitless, because the light of noon and midnight are exactly the same. Space is limitless, because the artificial light obscures rather than defines its boundaries. (Venturi, et. al., pg 49)

When lost in such a timeless, infinite plane, there is little else to do but gamble, and the spirit of the place is such that gambling is likely. This is the desired effect, that you will wander around until you sit at a machine or a table. And once at a table, you will stay.

In the passage from Learning From Las Vegas above, the first line is perhaps the most meaningful. Just as the inner space of a casino discourages you from leaving the casino, the lighting and use of space around any given table encourages you to stay at the table. You feel in control, protected, invulnerable; you keep betting.

Until Caesars has all your money.

## Right Next Door To Hell

Neighbor to Caesars Palace is the Mirage. Having no real historical theme, the Mirage is lauded as being a true original. “By challenging all the old rules and setting new standards for design, ambiance and entertainment,” a travel guide says, “the Mirage is likely to revolutionize hotels and casinos in much the same way Disney did theme parks.” (Sehlinger, pg 95) While from an aesthetic and atmospheric standpoint, this statement is right on the money, in terms of internal space and use of architecture to further its profits, the Mirage stole every trick it knows from Caesars Palace and intensified it.

It uses the same one-way people mover tricks, pulling people from the street and not vice-versa (in spite of the arrow which appears to indicate otherwise on Map 3). The Mirage also enhances its ability to discourage people from leaving by having only one real public exit location. All others are reserved for guests or for emergency use only.

While the map of the Mirage looks like its layout is somewhat more sane than that of Caesars, the reverse is actually true. Many of the spots on the casino floor completely block vision and travel through them. For example, the casino near the Mirage Buffet has a large section of blackjack tables, each inside an opened walled thatched roof hut. Next to it is a bar island. Also, tall palm trees abound in the place, especially around the atrium (see Plate 1), making sight from one side of the casino into the other casino problematic.

There are pathways connecting the various parts of the main public area of the Mirage, almost like trails cut through a jungle. This is in fact what they are, for the slot machines and tables and trees are so thick that these paths are really your only true source of movement through the hotel. It is significant that all these paths lead to the atrium (which, by the way, is about 50% plastic plants). Passage through the atrium is via a wooden foot bridge, maybe five or six feet wide, and curved, so that the exit is not visible from the casino. It differs from the other paths in that you do not walk through it on a whim. Compared to the other paths available to you, it is somehow more severe, a place you need a reason to enter.

One of the key features of the Mirage’s whole internal set up, is again, a non-spatial element, acting to enhance the effect of the inner space. In the Mirages case, this element is that of the sign. The only way to figure out how to get where you are going in the Mirage is to follow the signs; you simply cannot see the places you might want to be (the shark tank or the white tiger cage, for example) from the casino. These signs are organized in an incredibly confusing way, evoking shades of the Loony-Tunes cartoon’s white picket signs, with arrows pointing in every direction to every city imaginable. More sinister is the fact that the signs show you only vaguely where you want to go. To truly get there, you have to wander through tens of meters of dense slot jungle, usually to find another semi-helpful sign. In the interim (at least for my family) a group trying to find something specific within the Mirage gets split up when one of its members gets momentarily distracted by the exciting goings on at a nearby craps table or winning slot machine. (A stray member was usually found plugging quarters into a video poker machine, ahead two vodka and tonics.) At that point, it is back into the maelstrom of the casino to find the lost member, and often losing more, or stopping to play blackjack on the way.

Mirage lighting is somewhat brighter than Caesars Palace’s. This would seem to refute Venturi’s statement earlier about darkness being security, but in fact, brighter light works in the Mirage, because the theme and feeling is that of a laid-back resort, where you are among friends in paradise. Dark lighting would actually hinder this effect. Here, the inclusion into paradise provides the same security found in anonymity within Caesars.

Leaving nothing to chance, the mood is set within the Mirage by piped-in music (or occasionally live music from the Lagoon Saloon). Jimmy Buffet is a favorite, turning the Mirage into a communal Margaritaville.

All the music and signs and lighting would be completely ineffective, however, without the basic internal working of the Mirage being so convoluted. The jungle-like aspect is a very subtle, encouraging assault on our sense of adventure, simultaneously skewing our sense of direction and logic.

## Perfect Crime

Without actually barring anyone from leaving, the Mirage and Caesars both use internal space to put a subtle psychological pressure on people to remain inside, thus insuring a high profit margin for themselves. The gamblers stay voluntarily—a decision which they could easily reverse provided they take stock of their situation and find it the logical thing to do—inside an environment which discourages such awareness. The subtlety of this environment is perhaps even more effective on the Strip. After all, who expects subtlety in a place like Las Vegas?

\*This is a bet that the dice roller with either a) roll a 7 or 11 on his first roll, or b) roll a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on his first roll and then roll a duplicate of what he or she rolled before he or she rolls a 7. This bet pays off at 1:1, meaning that winning a $5 bet will win $5 (and you keep the original $5, obviously).

"拉斯维加斯万岁。 
把白天变成黑夜  
把黑夜变成白昼。 
如果你看了一次，你就再也不一样了。"  
   - 埃尔维斯-普雷斯利

"生活不是这个词... ...  
因为这都是为了钱。"  
   - 公敌

"你看这个？这是沙。你知道一百年后它会是什么吗？它将是沙子！这里什么都不长! 这里不会有任何东西生长！"  
   - Sam Kineson

"这就是里面的情况。 
不要让这一切传到外面去。"  
   - 范海伦

当在拉斯维加斯凯撒的论坛商店里喝着玛格丽特酒庆祝圣诞节时，我的叔叔对我们面前跳舞的巴克斯雕像的讲话大笑，说 "这是世界上最诚实的城市"。我不得不同意；拉斯维加斯对它是什么毫不掩饰。赌场只要有一半的机会，就会拿你的钱，这不是什么秘密。这是赌博的一个事实，虽然赌场显然没有炫耀，但也没有否认或掩盖这一事实。即便如此，某些拉斯维加斯的赌场还是以一种非常微妙的方式将你和你的钱分开，最明显的是通过他们对内部空间的使用。

凯撒宫和海市蜃楼是拉斯维加斯大道上两个相邻的酒店/赌场，它们的内部（以及在较小程度上的外部）设计几乎完全是为了增加利润。赌场的布局、照明和通道以一种几乎难以察觉的方式操纵着赌徒，专门用来将他们留在赌场内，让他们继续赌博。

### 糟糕的迷恋

为了理解这种操纵性设计的执行，必须对其动机有所了解，在这种情况下，它是通过提供赌博服务来赚钱的。为了充分理解这一点，必须对赌博的经济性做一些说明。从玩家的角度来看，赌博赚钱是一个运气、技巧和策略的问题。然而，从赌场的角度来看，这些因素都不重要，重要的是数量。赌博之所以有效，是因为游戏的设置方式使玩家和赌场都能合理地、有逻辑地期望保持这些前景。

对于玩家可能做出的任何特定赌注，他或她都有赢得该赌注的现实机会。例如，在掷骰子的赌桌上，押在过关线上的赌注有几乎一半的机会赢钱。拉斯维加斯所有的关键是 "几乎 "这个词。骰子游戏的组织方式是，对于任何给定的赌注，玩家输的几率略高于玩家赢的几率。两者之间的差距被称为房子的优势。骰子的通过线是拉斯维加斯任何赌注中最小的房子优势之一：1.4%。一种看法是，在进行了1000次过牌赌注后，庄家平均赢的赌注比输的多14次。在进行了1万次过关投注后，房子平均比它输的多赢140次。

这个基本前提是拉斯维加斯的成功之处。它让玩家有真正的机会赢钱，同时也让赌场持续赚钱。对玩家来说，他的赢钱机会保持不变。然而，对于赌场来说，他们只有在一个条件下才能持续赚钱：大量下注。

如上所示，下的赌注越多，赌场赢得的赌注就越多，因此赚的钱也就越多。然而，赌场的一个风险是，由于每个赌注对之前或之后的赌注的结果没有影响，任何一天的实际结果都可能不是 "平均 "的。有些日子他们可能做得更好，有些日子，他们可能做得更差，甚至赔钱。然而，随着下注次数的增加，这种情况发生的统计学概率会越来越小，所以下注越多，"平均 "情况实际发生的可能性就越大。

这直接导致了赌场最有利可图的商业策略：以这样一种方式经营赌场，从而导致尽可能多的赌注。他们可以通过两种方式做到这一点：吸引越来越多的赌徒，并确保赌徒一旦进入赌场，就能保持更长的赌博时间。本文调查的两家赌场积极采取了这两种策略，但除了向赌徒提供免费酒水外，其他赌场大多忽略了后者，而是专注于吸引顾客进入。这有很多方法，但由于这是一篇建筑学论文（撇开所有相反的证据），这里将只讨论建筑学完成这一任务的方法。

### 叩响天堂之门

尽管本文主要对赌场内部空间的运作感兴趣，但吸引路人进入赌场在很大程度上（如果不是完全）是赌场外部的功能。然而，拉斯维加斯就是拉斯维加斯，"标准 "的建筑形式在某种程度上是无益的。以对凯撒宫的描述为例。

前面的柱廊在平面上是San Pietro-Bernini，但在词汇和规模上是Yamasaki；蓝色和金色的马赛克作品是早期基督教的Galla Placidia墓。除此之外，还有一块Gio Ponti Pirelli-Barouque的石板，再往上是一个新古典主义的现代汽车旅馆的低翼。圣皮埃特罗广场内是象征性的停车场。在停放的车辆中，有五个喷泉，而不是卡洛-马德诺的两个；埃斯特别墅的柏树进一步点缀了停车环境。吉安-德-博洛尼亚的《萨宾妇女的强奸》以及维纳斯和大卫的雕像，在解剖学上略有夸张，使门廊周围的区域变得更加优美。几乎将维纳斯一分为二的是一个艾维斯，作为识别2号办公场所的标志。(Venturi, et. al., pg 51.)

用分析一个真正的罗马神庙的方法来分析这样的结构将是一场噩梦。幸运的是，在《向拉斯维加斯学习》中，罗伯特-文图里和丹尼斯-斯科特-布朗提供了一种不同的方式，将这样的建筑作为整个地带复杂秩序的一部分，作为体现商业企业的新兴方法的一部分。弗雷德里克-詹姆森在他没有引用黑格尔或其他众多思想家的时候，也许总结了这种观点，他说这种建筑的设计师......

...不再像高度现代主义的杰作和纪念碑那样，试图将一种不同的、独特的、高尚的、新的乌托邦式的语言插入周围城市肮脏的商业标志系统中，而是他们试图说这种语言，使用它的词汇和句法，因为这已经被象征性地 "从拉斯维加斯学到"。(Jameson, pg 39)

或者说，换句话说，凯撒让我们兴奋，因为它是我们认为拉斯维加斯令人兴奋的东西的一个体现。它是运气的商业化的体现，是拉斯维加斯经验的体现。

我认为这是胡说八道。

好吧，也许不完全是。虽然它看起来很高大上，过于学术化，而且通常在写作中充满了智力自慰，但凯撒就是拉斯维加斯，反之亦然的想法至少是合理的。我们被拉进一家赌场，就像我们被拉进任何其他商业场所一样，就像其他商店一样，在这种情况下，它出售的是拉斯维加斯体验。正如文图里所建议的那样，超大的招牌确实从远处抓住了我们的视线，并在我们进入之前牢牢抓住我们的注意力，但凯撒宫和海市蜃楼等地方的建筑比这更有力量，更积极地吸引我们。文丘里和他的同僚们似乎对Strip赌场的外部有很多关联；但是，他们对它们作为全世界商业地带的模型感兴趣。尽管这是一种有说服力的策略，并且有助于理解商业街，但将Strip与其他商业街放在一起是对赌场的误解。他们的分析中没有提到（而且在许多方面与之无关）的是一个特定的建筑可能以自己的议程对公众进行操作的方式。

例如，凯撒宫和海市蜃楼的建筑都是如此惊人的怪异，甚至脱离了拉斯维加斯的背景（或者，也许，特别是在那时），让人不禁好奇里面是什么。凯撒宫的OmniMax™剧院的大型黑色技术球体，不知为何能与建筑其他部分的怪异罗马式建筑融为一体。它说的是纯粹的颓废，这几乎需要调查。另一方面，海市蜃楼与地球上其他任何地方相比都不逊色，其光滑的金色眼镜三叉塔和（我甚至需要提到）每15分钟从作为前部草坪的湖中爆炸的火山（见图版2）。我们都知道这是个噱头，但一旦在它面前，忽视它的诱惑，就是一项超人的事业。从外面看，这两个赌场的纯物理冲击力使人几乎不可能在不进入的情况下通过这两个地方。

此外，两者都采用了一种几乎是明目张胆的方法，通过建筑来吸引顾客：传送带。在《向拉斯维加斯学习》之后的日子里，汽车对于拉斯维加斯的度假者来说不仅是不必要的，而且实际上是不受欢迎的。正如文图里所指出的，拉斯维加斯大道和它的酒店曾经是围绕汽车设计的，而现在则是以步行为主。(较新的酒店，如Excalibur，其停车场离他们很远，以至于他们用电车将客人从停车场运到酒店）。凯撒宫增加了一些迎合人流的设施，主要是增加和整合了三个 "人行道"，即传送带，把顾客从街上带到以前开车去的长距离的酒店。蜃楼酒店有一个几乎相同的系统。在这两种情况下，沿着传送带的旅程都伴随着一个友好的录音，称赞其各自酒店的特点。当然，这种声音可以在移动车的街道入口附近听到，吸引更多的人。另外，活动板房是有盖的，可以遮挡拉斯维加斯的阳光。虽然这最后一点听起来并不重要，但拉斯维加斯典型的夏日很容易突破100度，强烈的热度对一个坐在新英格兰的大楼里看报纸的人来说，比对一个在阴凉的门口邀请他或她进去的人来说，更容易被忽视。

## (迷失在）伊甸园

在赌场内部，建筑开始发挥其最关键的作用，特别是在凯撒宫和海市蜃楼的情况下。这两家赌场的内部空间的功能有一个简单的前提：把顾客留在里面。这种想法的执行是非常微妙的；与其说是阻止人们离开，不如说是不鼓励他们这样做。相反，是积极地不鼓励。这也许是凯撒宫最好的说明，里面的公共空间的布局有迷惑人的效果。

虽然不是皇宫的正式平面图，但地图1给出了一个足以说明这一目的的组织布局感。许多酒店只有一个赌场，而凯撒酒店有两个或三个赌场，分布在其底层。从地图上可以看出，从这些赌场中的一个到另一个至少有三种不同的方式，都不用离开大楼。你可以（而且经常这样做）穿过一条 "走廊"，然后从另一条走廊返回，往往不知道自己已经回到了来时的地方。请注意地图上C-F区的划分方式有些随意，例如，奥林匹克赌场就跨越了两个区。在相当广阔的赌场区域内几乎找不到地标；请注意每个赌场的入口附近都有一个大额角子机区域（C-4和E-9），每一个都有相同的标志装饰。

地图还显示了奇怪的弯曲的墙壁和房间，它们似乎无缘无故地突出来（C-2，E-16，D-3，F-1，等等）。这些都是为了扰乱内部景观，慢慢地扭曲了你的方向感。这些墙的奇怪的有机形状提供了一个虚假的锚，因为你可以看着一个墙来确定你的方向，看向远方，当你回头看时，不确定你是在看那个曲线，还是旁边的那个。这里没有窗户。所有的光线都被创造出来，没有办法通过光线的来源来判断方向。

在这种环境下，出口是非常难发现的。为了符合消防法规，它们都有发光的 "出口 "标志，但在一个以霓虹灯、闪光灯和警报器为标准的环境中，这几乎没有帮助。重新追踪你的脚步（假设你能做到的话，这不太可能）往往没有帮助，因为一些通往外面的门只作为入口，而不是出口，特别是地图上通往F区的人行道。也许在所有鼓励你不要离开的方式中，最微妙的是，把你拉进来的人行道只做这个；没有人行道是反方向的，把你带回街上。

这种控制出口的方法同样用于与凯撒集团相连的论坛商店（见F-4，以及地图2），这是一个标准的高档购物中心。人行道将你带入商场的入口，但离开商场的唯一途径是通过凯撒集团的赌场。到出口处也不是偶然的，需要沿着一条蜿蜒的中央动脉行走，经过商场内的每一家商店。这个系统不仅操纵游客在赌场里呆上一段时间（这时赌场的内部空间可以发挥它的魔力），而且让所有的商店也把他或她拉进来。

在凯撒的地图上无法看到的是赌桌和老虎机的布局。单独来看，赌场的空间在视觉上似乎相当容易抓住，然而，赌桌和机器的排列方式是这样的：通过赌场需要绕过和绕过它们。对此，再加上一些事实：老虎机的高度足以挡住你的视线，赌场里挤满了人，到处都是闪烁的灯光，当你走过赌场时，你往往更注意周围的赌博刺激而不是你要去的地方。所有这些事实在任何赌场都是常见的，但当与充分意识到这些事实并以加强其分散注意力的方式工作的内部空间布局相结合时，如凯撒宫的布局，其效果往往是在这样一个空间内的人分心，并推迟他们的理性思考。最终的结果是：他们花了比原来更多的时间来离开这个该死的地方，往往是更长的时间。

### 昏迷

凯撒内部的其他元素加强了这种混乱的质量，使时间和空间脱离了关系。虽然严格来说不是设计的空间，但在凯撒的范围和影响下，时钟和照明的元素作为建筑元素，构成了内部空间意图的一个关键部分。

赌场没有时钟。

言下之意，赌场也没有时间，它们永远是开放的，是一种永恒的黄昏。赌场的照明更突出了这一点。它们是非常黑暗的。这既增强了闪光灯的吸引力和分散注意力，也隐藏了你所在房间的边界。正如文丘里和布朗在他们讨论拉斯维加斯室内的一页中所说的那样

赌博室及其子空间的黑暗和封闭的结合使得隐私、保护、集中和控制成为可能。低矮的天花板下错综复杂的迷宫从未与外界的光线或外部空间连接。这使外面的光线或外面的空间失去了活力。这使居住者在空间和时间上迷失了方向。一个人失去了对自己身在何处和何时的追踪。时间是无限的，因为正午和午夜的光线是完全一样的。空间是无限的，因为人造光遮蔽了而不是定义了它的边界。(Venturi, et. al., pg 49)

当迷失在这样一个永恒的、无限的平面时，除了赌博，几乎没有其他事情可做，而这个地方的精神就是这样，赌博是可能的。这就是所期望的效果，你会四处游荡，直到你坐在机器或桌子前。而一旦坐上赌桌，你就会留下来。

在上述《从拉斯维加斯学习》的段落中，第一句话可能是最有意义的。正如赌场的内部空间不鼓励你离开赌场一样，任何特定赌桌周围的灯光和空间的使用都鼓励你留在赌桌前。你觉得自己处于控制之中，受到保护，无懈可击；你继续下注。

直到凯撒把你的钱都拿走。

### 就在地狱的隔壁

与凯撒宫相邻的是海市蜃楼。蜃楼没有真正的历史主题，但它被称赞为真正的原创。"一份旅游指南说："通过挑战所有的旧规则，为设计、氛围和娱乐设定新的标准，""蜃楼可能会像迪斯尼的主题公园一样，彻底改变酒店和赌场。(Sehlinger, pg 95)虽然从审美和氛围的角度来看，这种说法是正确的，但在内部空间和利用建筑来促进其利润方面，海市蜃楼从凯撒宫偷取了它所知道的每一个技巧，并强化了它。

它采用了同样的单向人行道技巧，从街上拉人，而不是反过来（尽管地图3上的箭头似乎表明了这一点）。蜃楼还通过只有一个真正的公共出口位置来增强其阻止人们离开的能力。所有其他的出口都是为客人保留的，或者只供紧急使用。

虽然海市蜃楼的地图看起来比凯撒的布局更理智一些，但实际上情况恰恰相反。赌场地板上的许多位置完全阻挡了视线，并在其中穿行。例如，靠近海市蜃楼自助餐厅的赌场有一大片21点牌桌，每张牌桌都在一个开墙的茅草屋内。旁边是一个酒吧岛。另外，这里高大的棕榈树比比皆是，特别是在中庭周围（见图版1），使得从赌场的一侧进入另一个赌场的视线成为问题。

有一些小路连接着海市蜃楼主要公共区域的各个部分，几乎就像在丛林中切开的小路。事实上就是这样，因为老虎机、赌桌和树木太多，这些小路是你在酒店中唯一真正的移动来源。重要的是，所有这些路径都通向中庭（顺便说一下，中庭大约有50%是塑料植物）。通过中庭是通过一个木制的脚踏桥，可能有五、六英尺宽，而且是弯曲的，所以从赌场看不到出口。它与其他路径的不同之处在于，你不会随心所欲地走过它。与其他可供你使用的路径相比，它在某种程度上更加严厉，是一个你需要有理由才能进入的地方。

蜃楼的整个内部设置的关键特征之一，又是一个非空间元素，起到加强内部空间的效果。在海市蜃楼的情况下，这个元素就是标志。要想知道如何在蜃楼里去哪里，唯一的办法就是跟着标志走；你根本无法从赌场里看到你可能想去的地方（例如鲨鱼池或白虎笼）。这些标志以一种令人难以置信的方式组织起来，让人联想到Loony-Tunes动画片中的白色栅栏标志，箭头指向每一个可以想象的城市的方向。更为险恶的是，这些标志只是模糊地告诉你想去的地方。要真正到达那里，你必须在几十米长的密缝丛林中徘徊，通常要找到另一个半有用的标志。在这期间（至少对我的家庭而言），当一个试图在幻境中寻找特定东西的团队被附近的骰子桌或中奖老虎机上的精彩活动瞬间分散了注意力。(一个游离的成员通常被发现在视频扑克机上插入硬币，前面是两杯伏特加和奎宁酒）。这时，又要回到赌场的漩涡中去寻找失散的成员，而且往往输得更多，或者在路上停下来玩21点。

海市蜃楼的灯光比凯撒宫的灯光要亮一些。这似乎反驳了文图里先前关于黑暗就是安全的说法，但事实上，较亮的灯光在海市蜃楼中起作用，因为其主题和感觉是一个悠闲的度假胜地，你在天堂的朋友中。黑暗的灯光实际上会阻碍这种效果。在这里，融入天堂的感觉提供了与凯撒集团内匿名的安全感。

蜃楼酒店的气氛是由管道音乐（或偶尔来自泻湖沙龙的现场音乐）设定的，不留任何机会。吉米-巴菲特（Jimmy Buffet）是人们的最爱，他把海市蜃楼变成了一个公共的玛格丽特维尔（Margaritaville）。

然而，如果没有海市蜃楼的基本内部工作如此曲折，所有的音乐、标志和照明都是完全无效的。丛林般的一面是非常微妙的，对我们的冒险意识的鼓励性攻击，同时歪曲了我们的方向感和逻辑。

### 完美犯罪

蜃楼和凯撒都没有真正禁止任何人离开，而是利用内部空间对人们施加一种微妙的心理压力，让他们留在里面，从而确保自己有高额的利润。赌徒们自愿留下来--只要他们审视自己的处境，发现这是合乎逻辑的事情，他们就可以轻易地改变这个决定--在一个不鼓励这种意识的环境中。这种环境的微妙性在脱衣舞场上也许更加有效。毕竟，在拉斯维加斯这样的地方，谁还指望有什么微妙之处？
