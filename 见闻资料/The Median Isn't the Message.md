Powerfully persuasive piece that helped me gain a "healthy" perspective on the statistics thrown out by doctors, researchers, other medical professionals--and the media. No understatement to say, this essay made a huge difference in my life and health.

**The Median Isn't the Message**  
**by Stephen Jay Gould**

**My life has recently intersected**, in a most personal way, two of Mark Twain's famous quips. One I shall defer to the end of this essay. The other (sometimes attributed to Disraeli), identifies three species of mendacity, each worse than the one before - lies, damned lies, and statistics.  

**Consider the standard example** of stretching the truth with numbers - a case quite relevant to my story. Statistics recognizes different measures of an "average," or central tendency. The mean is our usual concept of an overall average - add up the items and divide them by the number of sharers (100 candy bars collected for five kids next Halloween will yield 20 for each in a just world). The median, a different measure of central tendency, is the half-way point. If I line up five kids by height, the median child is shorter than two and taller than the other two (who might have trouble getting their mean share of the candy). A politician in power might say with pride, "The mean income of our citizens is $15,000 per year." The leader of the opposition might retort, "But half our citizens make less than $10,000 per year." Both are right, but neither cites a statistic with impassive objectivity. The first invokes a mean, the second a median. (Means are higher than medians in such cases because one millionaire may outweigh hundreds of poor people in setting a mean; but he can balance only one mendicant in calculating a median).

**The larger issue** that creates a common distrust or contempt for statistics is more troubling. Many people make an unfortunate and invalid separation between heart and mind, or feeling and intellect. In some contemporary traditions, abetted by attitudes stereotypically centered on Southern California, feelings are exalted as more "real" and the only proper basis for action - if it feels good, do it - while intellect gets short shrift as a hang-up of outmoded elitism. Statistics, in this absurd dichotomy, often become the symbol of the enemy. As Hilaire Belloc wrote, "Statistics are the triumph of the quantitative method, and the quantitative method is the victory of sterility and death."

**This is a personal story of statistics**, properly interpreted, as profoundly nurturant and life-giving. It declares holy war on the downgrading of intellect by telling a small story about the utility of dry, academic knowledge about science. Heart and head are focal points of one body, one personality.

**In July 1982, I learned that I was suffering from abdominal mesothelioma**, a rare and serious cancer usually associated with exposure to asbestos. When I revived after surgery, I asked my first question of my doctor and chemotherapist: "What is the best technical literature about mesothelioma?" She replied, with a touch of diplomacy (the only departure she has ever made from direct frankness), that the medical literature contained nothing really worth reading.

**Of course, trying to keep an intellectual away** from literature works about as well as recommending chastity to Homo sapiens, the sexiest primate of all. As soon as I could walk, I made a beeline for Harvard's Countway medical library and punched mesothelioma into the computer's bibliographic search program. An hour later, surrounded by the latest literature on abdominal mesothelioma, I realized with a gulp why my doctor had offered that humane advice. The literature couldn't have been more brutally clear: mesothelioma is incurable, with a median mortality of only eight months after discovery. I sat stunned for about fifteen minutes, then smiled and said to myself: so that's why they didn't give me anything to read. Then my mind started to work again, thank goodness.

**If a little learning could ever be a dangerous thing**, I had encountered a classic example. Attitude clearly matters in fighting cancer. We don't know why (from my old-style materialistic perspective, I suspect that mental states feed back upon the immune system). But match people with the same cancer for age, class, health, socioeconomic status, and, in general, those with positive attitudes, with a strong will and purpose for living, with commitment to struggle, with an active response to aiding their own treatment and not just a passive acceptance of anything doctors say, tend to live longer. A few months later I asked Sir Peter Medawar, my personal scientific guru and a Nobelist in immunology, what the best prescription for success against cancer might be. "A sanguine personality," he replied. Fortunately (since one can't reconstruct oneself at short notice and for a definite purpose), I am, if anything, even-tempered and confident in just this manner.

**Hence the dilemma for humane doctors**: since attitude matters so critically, should such a sombre conclusion be advertised, especially since few people have sufficient understanding of statistics to evaluate what the statements really mean? From years of experience with the small-scale evolution of Bahamian land snails treated quantitatively, I have developed this technical knowledge - and I am convinced that it played a major role in saving my life. Knowledge is indeed power, in Bacon's proverb.

**The problem may be briefly stated**: What does "median mortality of eight months" signify in our vernacular? I suspect that most people, without training in statistics, would read such a statement as "I will probably be dead in eight months" - the very conclusion that must be avoided, since it isn't so, and since attitude matters so much.

**I was not, of course, overjoyed**, but I didn't read the statement in this vernacular way either. My technical training enjoined a different perspective on "eight months median mortality." The point is a subtle one, but profound - for it embodies the distinctive way of thinking in my own field of evolutionary biology and natural history.

**We still carry the historical baggage** of a Platonic heritage that seeks sharp essences and definite boundaries. (Thus we hope to find an unambiguous "beginning of life" or "definition of death," although nature often comes to us as irreducible continua.) This Platonic heritage, with its emphasis in clear distinctions and separated immutable entities, leads us to view statistical measures of central tendency wrongly, indeed opposite to the appropriate interpretation in our actual world of variation, shadings, and continua. In short, we view means and medians as the hard "realities," and the variation that permits their calculation as a set of transient and imperfect measurements of this hidden essence. If the median is the reality and variation around the median just a device for its calculation, the "I will probably be dead in eight months" may pass as a reasonable interpretation.

**But all evolutionary biologists know** that variation itself is nature's only irreducible essence. Variation is the hard reality, not a set of imperfect measures for a central tendency. Means and medians are the abstractions. Therefore, I looked at the mesothelioma statistics quite differently - and not only because I am an optimist who tends to see the doughnut instead of the hole, but primarily because I know that variation itself is the reality. I had to place myself amidst the variation.

**When I learned about the eight-month median**, my first intellectual reaction was: fine, half the people will live longer; now what are my chances of being in that half. I read for a furious and nervous hour and concluded, with relief: damned good. I possessed every one of the characteristics conferring a probability of longer life: I was young; my disease had been recognized in a relatively early stage; I would receive the nation's best medical treatment; I had the world to live for; I knew how to read the data properly and not despair.

**Another technical point** then added even more solace. I immediately recognized that the distribution of variation about the eight-month median would almost surely be what statisticians call "right skewed." (In a symmetrical distribution, the profile of variation to the left of the central tendency is a mirror image of variation to the right. In skewed distributions, variation to one side of the central tendency is more stretched out - left skewed if extended to the left, right skewed if stretched out to the right.) The distribution of variation had to be right skewed, I reasoned. After all, the left of the distribution contains an irrevocable lower boundary of zero (since mesothelioma can only be identified at death or before). Thus, there isn't much room for the distribution's lower (or left) half - it must be scrunched up between zero and eight months. But the upper (or right) half can extend out for years and years, even if nobody ultimately survives. The distribution must be right skewed, and I needed to know how long the extended tail ran - for I had already concluded that my favorable profile made me a good candidate for that part of the curve.

**The distribution was indeed, strongly right skewed**, with a long tail (however small) that extended for several years above the eight month median. I saw no reason why I shouldn't be in that small tail, and I breathed a very long sigh of relief. My technical knowledge had helped. I had read the graph correctly. I had asked the right question and found the answers. I had obtained, in all probability, the most precious of all possible gifts in the circumstances - substantial time. I didn't have to stop and immediately follow Isaiah's injunction to Hezekiah - set thine house in order for thou shalt die, and not live. I would have time to think, to plan, and to fight.

**One final point** about statistical distributions. They apply only to a prescribed set of circumstances - in this case to survival with mesothelioma under conventional modes of treatment. If circumstances change, the distribution may alter. I was placed on an experimental protocol of treatment and, if fortune holds, will be in the first cohort of a new distribution with high median and a right tail extending to death by natural causes at advanced old age.

**It has become, in my view, a bit too trendy** to regard the acceptance of death as something tantamount to intrinsic dignity. Of course I agree with the preacher of Ecclesiastes that there is a time to love and a time to die - and when my skein runs out I hope to face the end calmly and in my own way. For most situations, however, I prefer the more martial view that death is the ultimate enemy - and I find nothing reproachable in those who rage mightily against the dying of the light.

**The swords of battle are numerous**, and none more effective than humor. My death was announced at a meeting of my colleagues in Scotland, and I almost experienced the delicious pleasure of reading my obituary penned by one of my best friends (the so-and-so got suspicious and checked; he too is a statistician, and didn't expect to find me so far out on the right tail). Still, the incident provided my first good laugh after the diagnosis. Just think, I almost got to repeat Mark Twain's most famous line of all: _the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated_.

我的生活最近以一种最个人的方式与马克·吐温的两句名言交汇。其中一句我将推迟到本文的结尾。另一句（有时被归功于迪斯雷利）确定了三种虚伪，每种都比前一种更糟糕-谎言，该死的谎言和统计数据。

考虑用数字拉长真相的标准示例-这种情况与我的故事非常相关。统计学承认不同的“平均值”或中心趋势度量标准。平均数是我们通常概念的总体平均值-将项目相加并将它们除以分享者的数量（在下一个万圣节，为五个孩子收集100个糖果棒，将在公正的世界中为每个孩子产生20个）。中位数是另一种中心趋势度量标准。如果我按身高排列五个孩子，中位数孩子比其他两个孩子矮，比另外两个孩子高（他们可能难以获得糖果的平均份额）。执政的政治家可能自豪地说：“我们公民的平均收入为每年15,000美元。”反对派领袖可能回答：“但我们有一半的公民年收入低于10,000美元。”两者都是正确的，但都没有引用冷静客观的统计数据。第一个引用了平均值，第二个引用了中位数。（在这种情况下，平均数比中位数高，因为一位百万富翁可以在设置平均数时超过数百个穷人；但他在计算中位数时只能平衡一位乞丐）。

导致一般人对统计数据产生普遍不信任或蔑视的更大问题更加令人不安。许多人不幸地并且无效地将心脏和头脑或感觉和智力分开。在一些当代传统中，加上以南加州为中心的陈规陋习的态度，情感被吹捧为更“真实”的，并且是行动的唯一适当基础-如果感觉好，就做它-而智力则被视为陈旧精英主义的恶习。在这种荒谬的二分法中，统计数据通常成为敌人的象征。正如希莱尔·贝洛克所写：“统计数据是数量方法的胜利，而数量方法是不育和死亡的胜利。”

这是一篇关于统计数据的个人故事，如果正确解释，它是非常滋养和给生命以力量的。它通过讲述一个关于科学干燥学术知识的实用小故事，来宣告人性化医生降低智力的圣战。心和头是一个身体、一个人格的焦点。

1982年7月，我得知我患有腹膜间皮瘤，这是一种罕见而严重的癌症，通常与接触石棉有关。手术后当我恢复意识时，我向我的医生和化疗师问了我的第一个问题：“有关腹膜间皮瘤的最佳技术文献是什么？”她回答道，带有一丝外交风度（她唯一一次没有直率地说话），医学文献中没有真正值得读的东西。

当然，试图远离文学的智力与建议人类独身一样无效，是所有性感灵长类动物中最性感的种类。当我能走路时，我径直走到哈佛的康威医学图书馆，将腹膜间皮瘤输入计算机的文献搜索程序。一个小时后，我被最新的腹膜间皮瘤文献所包围，我意识到为什么我的医生提出了那个人道主义的建议。文献不能更加残酷地表明：腹膜间皮瘤是不可治愈的，发现后的中位死亡率仅为八个月。我愣住了大约十五分钟，然后微笑着对自己说：原来他们没有给我任何东西阅读的原因就是这样。然后我的思维再次开始工作，谢天谢地。

如果某种程度的学习可能会带来危险，那么我遇到了一个典型的例子。态度在对抗癌症方面显然很重要。我们不知道为什么（从我旧式唯物主义的角度来看，我怀疑心理状态会对免疫系统产生反馈作用）。但是，将患有相同癌症的人与年龄、阶级、健康、社会经济地位匹配，总的来说，那些具有积极态度、有强烈意愿和生活目的、致力于奋斗、积极响应自己的治疗而不仅仅是被动接受医生说什么的人，往往能活得更长时间。几个月后，我问我的个人科学顾问和一位免疫学的诺贝尔奖得主彼得·梅达沃爵士，对抗癌症的最佳处方是什么。“乐观的个性，”他回答道。幸运的是（因为不能在短时间内为一个明确的目的重新构建自己），我即使是在这种情况下，也是平静和自信的。

因此，对于人性化的医生来说，存在一个困境：既然态度如此重要，那么是否应该宣传这样一个严肃的结论，特别是因为很少有人具有足够的统计知识来评估这些陈述的真正含义？通过对巴哈马陆地蜗牛的小规模演化进行多年的经验积累，我已经掌握了这些技术知识-并且我相信它在挽救我的生命方面发挥了重要作用。在培根的谚语中，知识确实是力量。

问题可以简要地陈述：在我们的白话语境中，“八个月的中位死亡率”意味着什么？我怀疑大多数没有统计学培训的人会将这样的声明解读为“我可能会在八个月内死亡”-这正是必须避免的结论，因为它并不是这样，而且由于态度如此重要，因此必须避免。

当然，我并不感到高兴，但我也没有以这种日常用语的方式阅读该声明。我的技术培训给“八个月的中位死亡率”带来了不同的视角。这一点是微妙的，但是深刻的-因为它体现了我自己的进化生物学和自然史领域中思维方式的独特之处。

我们仍然沿用着柏拉图遗产的历史包袱，寻求清晰的本质和明确的界限。（因此，我们希望找到明确的“生命开始”或“死亡定义”，尽管自然常常以不可约的连续形式呈现给我们。）这种柏拉图遗产，强调清晰的区分和分离的不可变实体，导致我们错误地看待中心倾向度量的统计措施，确实与我们实际的变异、渐变和连续的世界中的适当解释相反。简而言之，我们将均值和中位数视为硬性的“现实”，将允许它们计算的变异视为一组短暂的、不完美的测量这种隐藏本质的变量。如果中位数是现实，其周围的变异只是计算其值的一种设备，那么“我可能会在八个月内死亡”就可以通过作为一个合理的解释。

但是，所有进化生物学家都知道，变异本身才是自然界的唯一不可约本质。变异是现实的硬度，而不是一个完美的测量中心趋势度量标准的一组不完美的测量。均值和中位数是抽象的。因此，我完全不同地看待腹膜间皮瘤统计数据-不仅因为我是一个倾向于看到甜甜圈而不是洞的乐观主义者，而主要是因为我知道变异本身才是现实。我必须将自己置于变异之中。

当我了解到八个月的中位数时，我的第一个智力反应是：好的，一半的人会活得更久；那我在那一半中的机会是多少。我疯狂而紧张地阅读了一个小时，得出结论：该死的好。我拥有延长寿命的概率所需的每一个特征：我年轻；我的疾病在相对早的阶段被认识到；我将接受全国最好的医疗治疗；我有整个世界要生活；我知道如何正确阅读数据而不绝望。

另一个技术点之后，更加安心了。我立刻意识到，关于八个月中位数的变化分布几乎肯定是统计学家所谓的“右偏”的。（在对称分布中，中心趋势左侧的变化轮廓是右侧变化的镜像。在右偏分布中，中心趋势的一侧的变化更加拉长——如果向左延伸则为左偏，如果向右拉伸则为右偏。）变化分布必须是右偏的，我推断。毕竟，分布的左侧包含不可逆转的下限为零（因为只有在死亡或之前才能识别出胸膜瘤）。因此，分布的下半部分（或左侧）没有太多的空间——它必须在零和八个月之间挤压。但是，即使没有人最终存活，分布的上半部分（或右侧）可以延伸数年甚至数十年。分布必须是右偏的，而我需要知道延伸的尾巴有多长——因为我已经得出结论，我有一个有利的状况，使我成为该曲线部分的好候选人。

分布确实是右偏的，尾巴很长（虽然很小），超过了八个月的中位数。我看不出为什么我不应该在那个小尾巴里，我长舒了一口气。我的技术知识有所帮助。我正确地阅读了图表。我提出了正确的问题并找到了答案。在这种情况下，我已经获得了所有可能的最珍贵的礼物——充裕的时间。我不必停下来立即遵循以赛亚对希西家的命令——为你的死亡做好准备，不要活下去。我有时间思考、计划和战斗。

最后一个关于统计分布的观点是，它们只适用于一组规定的情况——在这种情况下，是在常规治疗下存活的胸膜瘤患者。如果情况改变，分布可能会改变。我被安排接受实验性治疗方案，如果幸运的话，将成为一个新的高中位数分布的第一批，其右尾一直延伸到自然死亡的高龄。

在我看来，将接受死亡视为内在尊严有点过于时髦了。当然，我同意传道书中的说法，有爱的时间和有死的时间——当我的命运耗尽时，我希望能够冷静地面对终结，以我的方式结束。然而，在大多数情况下，我更喜欢更军事化的观点，即死亡是终极敌人——我认为那些对光明消逝之死愤怒的人没有任何错。

战斗之剑很多，其中没有比幽默更有效的了。我的死亡在我苏格兰同事的会议上宣布，我几乎体验到了由我最好的朋友写的我的讣告所带来的愉悦（他怀疑并检查了一下；他也是一个统计学家，没有想到我会在右偏分布的极端处）。尽管如此，这件事情给了我诊断后的第一个大笑。想想看，我差点重复了马克吐温最著名的一句话：我的死讯被大大夸张了。
