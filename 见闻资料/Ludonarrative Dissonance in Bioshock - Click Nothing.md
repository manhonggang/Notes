**The problem of what the game is about**

\[traduit en francais [ici](http://www.gamekult.com/blog/mawashigeri/204965/bioshock-la-dissonance-ludo-narrative.html)\]

About [a year ago](https://clicknothing.typepad.com/click_nothing/2006/11/i_stand_correct.html), I praised [Ian Bogost's critique of Bully](http://seriousgamessource.com/features/feature_110206_bully_1.php) and lamented the unfortunate lack of game criticism, as distinct from game reviews. Roughly speaking, we could say game criticism is for game developers and professionals who want to think about the nature of games and what they mean. Game reviews are for the public – for people who play games – and they are intended to help those people make decisions about which games they should buy. Both are valuable and important contributions, but sadly, we seem to only have one.

So this is not going to be a review of [Bioshock](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/924919.asp). [If](http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/bioshock/815688p1.html) [you](http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/bioshock/review.html) [want](http://pc.ign.com/articles/813/813641p1.html) [a](http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3163060) [review](http://www.gamecritics.com/bioshock-review) [of](http://www.gametrailers.com/gamereview.php?id=2610) [Bioshock](http://www.gameshark.com/reviews/2736/BioShock-Review.htm) [go](http://www.firingsquad.com/games/bioshock_review/) [here](http://www.fragland.net/reviews.php?id=1067). This is going to be a critique of Bioshock – a limited one perhaps, because I don’t have the time to really give this game the 50,000 plus word critical examination I think it deserves, but it will be a critique nonetheless.

Before I tear into it though, I want to apologize to the folks who worked on the game. If this was a review, it would be glowing, but as a critique it’s going to be pretty rough. I mostly really enjoyed this game, and aside from a few minor quibbles that are inevitable coming from [a guy who lists](http://blog.ubi.com/farcry2/article.php?content_id=6337) [System Shock 2](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/185706.asp) as his favorite game of all time, I basically think the game is great. In a very important sense Bioshock lives up the expectations created by its ancestor by inviting us to ask important and compelling questions, which is wonderful. But unfortunately, in most cases, I think the answers Bioshock provides to those questions are confused, frustrating, deceptive and unsatisfactory.

To cut straight to the heart of it, Bioshock seems to suffer from a powerful dissonance between what it is about as a game, and what it is about as a story. By throwing the narrative and ludic elements of the work into opposition, the game seems to openly mock the player for having believed in the fiction of the game at all. The leveraging of the game’s narrative structure against its ludic structure all but destroys the player’s ability to feel connected to either, forcing the player to either abandon the game in protest (which I almost did) or simply accept that the game cannot be enjoyed as both a game and a story, and to then finish it for the mere sake of finishing it.

So what is the form of this dissonance and why does it shatter the internal consistency of the work so totally?

Bioshock is a game about the relationship between freedom and power. It is at once (and among other things) an examination and a criticism of [Randian Objectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29). It says, rather explicitly, that the notion that rational self-interest is moral or good is a trap, and that the ‘power’ we derive from complete and unchecked freedom necessarily corrupts, and ultimately destroys us.

The game begins by offering the player two contracts.

One is a ludic contract – literally ‘seek power and you will progress’. This ludic contract is in line with the values underlying [Randian rational self-interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29#Ethics:_Rational_self-interest). The rules of the game say ‘it is best if I do what is best for me without consideration for others’. This is a pretty standard value in single player games where all the other characters in the game world (or at very least all of the characters in play in the game world) tend to be in direct conflict with the player. However, it must be pointed out that Bioshock goes the extra mile and ties this game mechanical contract back to the narrative in spectacular fashion through the use of the Little Sisters. By ‘dressing up’ the mechanics of this contract in well realized content I literally experience what it means to gain by doing what is best for me (I get more Adam) without consideration for others (by harvesting Little Sisters).

Thus, the ludic contract works in the sense that I actually feel the themes of the game being expressed through mechanics. The game literally made me feel a cold detachment from the fate of the Little Sisters, who I assumed could not be saved (or even if they could, would suffer some worse fate at the hands of Tenenbaum). Harvesting them in pursuit of my own self-interest seems not only the best choice mechanically, but also the right choice. This is exactly what this game needed to do – make me experience – feel – what it means to embrace a social philosophy that I would not under normal circumstances consider.

To be successful, the game would need to not only make me somehow adopt this difficult philosophy, but then put me in a pressure-cooker where the systems and content slowly transform the game landscape until I find myself caught in the aforementioned ‘trap’. Unfortunately, when we take the first, ludic contract and map it to the game’s second contract, the game falls apart.

The game’s second contract is a narrative contract – ‘help Atlas and you will progress’. There are three fundamental problems with this being the narrative contract of the game.

First, this contract is not in line with the values underlying Randian rational self-interest; ‘helping someone else’ is presented as the right thing to do by the story, yet the opposite proposition appears to be true under the mechanics.

Second, Atlas is openly opposed to Ryan, yet again, as mentioned above, I am philosophically aligned with Ryan by my acceptance of the mechanics. Why do I want to stop Ryan, or kill him, or listen to Atlas at all? Ryan’s philosophy is in fact the guiding principle of the mechanics that I am experiencing through play.

Thirdly, I don’t have a choice with regards to the proposition of the contract. I am constrained by the design of the game to help Atlas, even if I am opposed to the principle of helping someone else. In order to go forward in the game, I must do as Atlas says because the game does not offer me the freedom to choose sides in the conflict between Ryan and Atlas.

This is a serious problem. In the game’s mechanics, I am offered the freedom to choose to adopt an Objectivist approach, but I also have the freedom to reject that approach and to rescue the Little Sisters, even though it is not in my own (net) best interest to do so (even over time according to [this fascinating data](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/9.48000#318863)).

Yet in the game’s fiction on the other hand, I do not have that freedom to choose between helping Atlas or not. Under the ludic contract, if I accept to adopt an Objectivist approach, I can harvest Little Sisters. If I reject that approach, I can rescue them. Under the story, if I reject an Objectivist approach, I can help Atlas and oppose Ryan, and if I choose to adopt an Objectivist approach – well too bad… I can stop playing the game, but that’s about it.

That’s the dissonance I am talking about, and it is disturbing. Now, disturbing is one thing, but let’s just accept for a moment that we forgive that. Let’s imagine that we say ‘well, it’s a game, and the mechanics are great, so I will overlook the fact that the story is kind of forcing me to do something out of character…’. That’s far from the end of the world. Many games impose a narrative on the player. But when it is revealed that the rationale for why the player helps Atlas is not a ludic constraint that we graciously accept in order to enjoy the game, but rather is a narrative one that is dictated to us, what was once disturbing becomes insulting. The game openly mocks us for having willingly suspended our disbelief in order to enjoy it.

The feeling is reminiscent of the [Ikea commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFztDZRtplw) where we are mocked for feeling sorry for the lamp. But instead of being tricked by a quirky 60 second ad, we are mocked after a 20 hour commitment for having sympathy for the limitations of a medium. The ‘twist’ in the plot is a dues ex machina built upon the very weaknesses of game stories that we – as players – agree to accept in order to have some sort of narrative framework to flavor our fiddling about with mechanics. To mock us for accepting the weaknesses of the medium not only insults the player, but it’s really kind of ‘out of bounds’ (except as comedy or as a meta element – of which it appears to be neither).

Now, I understand the above criticism is harsh, and also that it is built upon complex arguments, so let me clarify a few things.

First, this is not a review. If it was, I would be raving (mostly) about the interesting abilities, fun weapons, beautiful environments, engaging enemy ‘eco-system’, freedom of choice, openness to explore, and a mountain of other fantastic things. But I’m not talking about all of the reasons players should play this game and all of the reasons they will certainly enjoy it. I am talking about the fabric of the game. I am talking about the nature of the game at the most fundamental levels that I can perceive. I am talking about weaknesses that I see (or more importantly that I feel) when I become deeply drawn into the game and really experience what is being expressed in its systems and content.

Second, the points I am making may seem trivial or bizarre to a lot of people, and certainly the arguments the points are built on are complicated. I am sure they are hard for many game developers to understand and impossible for laymen. Honestly – I only partially understand what I am experiencing when I play a game as thoroughly as I played BioShock, and frankly I only half understand what I am saying as I write this. With the ‘language of games’ being as limited as it is, understanding what I am ‘reading’ is hard, and trying to articulate it back to people in a useful way is a full order of magnitude harder.

So take this criticism for what it is worth. It is the complaint of a semi-literate, half-blind Neanderthal, trying to comprehend the sandblasted hieroglyphic poetry of a one-armed Egyptian mason.

Not long ago – in [my rebuttal to Ebert](https://clicknothing.typepad.com/click_nothing/2007/08/on-authorship-i.html) – I asserted that [GTA: San Andreas](http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914983.asp?q=GTA%20San%20Andreas) was a more important work of art than [Crash](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/). Now, I’m not going to bother to announce that BioShock is a work of art. I will, however, point to another often used film-game comparison… the one that states that games do not yet have their [Citizen Kane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/). Similarities between Orson Welles and Andrew Ryan aside, BioShock is not our Citizen Kane. But it does – more than any game I have ever played – show us how close we are to achieving that milestone. BioShock reaches for it, and slips. But we leave our deepest footprints when we pick ourselves up from a fall. It seems to me that it will take us several years to learn from BioShock’s mistakes and create a new generation of games that do manage to successful marry their ludic and narrative themes into a consistent and fully realized whole. From that new generation of games, perhaps the one that is to BioShock as BioShock is to System Shock 2 will be our Citizen Kane.

## 游戏讲述的究竟是什么

大约一年前，我称赞了 Ian Bogost 对《恶霸鲁尼》的批评，并感叹游戏“批评”（criticism）——有别于游戏“评测”（review）——极其匮乏。粗略地说，游戏批评写给开发者与业内人士，探讨游戏本质及其含义；而游戏评测面向玩家，帮助他们决定是否购买。两者皆有价值，但遗憾的是，我们几乎只剩评测。

因此，本文不会是《生化奇兵》的评测。如果你想看评测，网络上随处可见；本文是对《生化奇兵》的批评。篇幅有限，远非五万字的深度解剖，但仍旨在批评。

在开撕之前，我要先向开发团队道歉：若这是评测，我会大加赞赏；然而批评注定严厉。我非常喜欢这款游戏，除了一些小毛病——毕竟我把《系统震撼 2》列为史上最爱——它整体上佳。《生化奇兵》继承前作衣钵，引导我们提出重要而动人的问题，这点极好；但可惜，它给出的答案往往混乱、沮丧、带有欺骗性，且难以令人满意。

## “路德—叙事”失调

直击核心：《生化奇兵》在“游戏性”（ludic）与“叙事”（narrative）之间存在强烈失调（ludonarrative dissonance）。当二者彼此冲突时，作品仿佛嘲弄玩家竟会相信其虚构。叙事结构与玩法结构相互抵消，玩家只得要么愤而弃坑（我差点如此），要么接受“这既非好游戏，也非好故事”，硬着头皮通关。

---

## 自由与权力的两份“契约”

1. **玩法契约**：追求力量即可推进。它贴合兰德式“理性利己”。游戏规则告诉你：“无视他人，利己最好。”《生化奇兵》通过“小妹妹”把这一机制包装得栩栩如生：收割她们可获得更多 Adam，自利而不顾她人。机制本身让我真实体验到“冷漠收割”的感觉。
    
2. **叙事契约**：帮助 Atlas 即可推进。但这与理性利己相悖；而且我在机制层面已与 Ryan 同路——为何要帮 Atlas？更糟糕的是，游戏不给我选边的自由，非帮 Atlas 不可。
    

---

## 矛盾的后果

于是：玩法允许我选择收割或救赎小妹妹；叙事却强迫我帮助 Atlas。若我坚持客观主义立场，别无他途只能退坑。这种失调令人不适；若玩家原谅它，仅当普通“剧情限制”也无大碍。可剧情的“反转”却揭示：玩家帮助 Atlas 并非出于玩法需要，而是被剧本骗了——这就不止不适，而是侮辱。

---

## 被强加的选择与玩家的无力感

就玩法机制而言，游戏让我自由地决定是否采取客观主义立场：

- 如果我接受这种立场，我可以“收割”小妹妹；
    
- 如果我拒绝，我就“拯救”她们。
    

可在剧情层面，这样的自由却被剥夺——无论我是否认同客观主义，我都**必须**帮助 Atlas，才能继续游戏流程。这导致：

1. 玩法里，我可以为利己或为利他自由抉择；
    
2. 剧情里，我却只能顺从 Atlas 而无法选边；
    
3. 若我真想坚持 Ryan 的哲学，只剩一个选项：**关掉游戏**。
    

这就是“路德—叙事失调”最刺痛人的地方。

---

## 从“令人不适”到“令人恼怒”

这种失调本就让人坐立难安——你得一边享受优秀的机制，一边强忍“做着违心之事”的违和感。许多游戏都会对玩家“强加剧情”，勉强还能接受。

可《生化奇兵》的问题是：推动我帮助 Atlas 的理由并非玩法限制，而是剧本强加的叙事设定。当剧情反转揭露这一点时，原本的“难受”瞬间升级成“被羞辱”——游戏仿佛嘲笑玩家竟然愿意为享受玩法而妥协、去相信这套虚构。

---

## 嘲弄玩家的“伊凯亚台灯”时刻

这种感觉让我想起那支伊凯亚广告：观众因为可怜被丢弃的台灯而动容，却立刻被旁白奚落“它不过是个旧灯泡”。区别只在于——广告不过 60 秒，而玩家在《生化奇兵》里投入了 20 多小时。

编剧利用“游戏叙事先天局限”来设置 Deus Ex Machina（强行救世的神转折），再转头嘲笑玩家的包容，这不仅让人难堪，还带有一点“越界”——除非它想当喜剧或玩元叙事，但显然两者皆非。

---

## 澄清两点

1. 这篇文章不是评测；若是评测，我会大谈它的武器设计、关卡氛围、生态系统和探索自由。此处只讨论作品最底层的纤维，即玩法与叙事的矛盾。
    
2. 上述论证听起来或许晦涩；即便开发者，也未必人人都能完全认同。我自己在游玩至深、试图剖析时，也常感觉只是“半文盲、半瞎的尼安德特人”在解读风蚀的象形诗。

## 《公民凯恩》尚未来临，但我们愈发接近

常被提及的“游戏尚无《公民凯恩》”这一比较仍在耳边回响。《生化奇兵》不是我们的《公民凯恩》，然而它比我玩过的任何游戏都更接近那一座里程碑；它奋力攀登却失足，而我们跌倒时留下最深的足迹。我相信，未来数年业界会汲取《生化奇兵》的错误，创造出真正把玩法主题与叙事主题完美融合的新一代作品；或许，那部“相对于《生化奇兵》正如《生化奇兵》之于《系统震撼 2》”的游戏，才是我们的《公民凯恩》。
