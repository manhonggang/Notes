# Climbing The Wrong Hill. What computer science can teach you… | by Chris Dixon | Medium

> What computer science can teach you about your career

I know a brilliant young kid who graduated from college a year ago and now works at a large investment bank. He has decided he hates Wall Street and wants to work at a tech startup (good!). He recently gave notice to his bosses, who responded by putting on a dog and pony show to convince him to stay. If he stays at the bank, the bosses tell him, he’ll get a raise and greater responsibility. Joining the technology industry, he’d be starting from scratch. He is now thinking that he’ll stay, despite his convincing declaration that he has no long term ambitions in finance.

Over the years, I’ve run into many prospective employees in similar situations. When I ask them a very obvious question: “What do you want to be doing in 10 years?” The answer is invariably “working at or founding a tech startup” — yet most of them decide to remain on their present path and not join a startup. Then, a few years later, they finally quit their job, but only after having spent years in an industry they didn’t enjoy, and that didn’t really advance them toward their long term ambitions.

> How can smart, ambitious people stay working in an area where they have no long term ambitions? I think a good analogy for the mistake they are making can be found in computer science.

A classic problem in computer science is [hill climbing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing). Imagine you are dropped at a random spot on a hilly terrain, where you can only see a few feet in each direction due to fog. The goal is to get to the highest hill.

Consider the simplest algorithm. At any given moment, take a step in the direction that takes you higher. The risk with this method is if you happen to start near the lower hill, you’ll end up at the top of that lower hill, not the top of the tallest hill.

A more sophisticated version of this algorithm adds some randomness into your walk. You start out with lots of randomness and reduce the amount of randomness over time. This gives you a better chance of meandering near the bigger hill before you start your focused, non-random climb.

Another and generally better algorithm has you repeatedly drop yourself in random parts of the terrain, do simple hill climbing, and then after many such attempts step back and decide which of the hills were highest.

Going back to the job candidate, he has the benefit of having a less foggy view of his terrain. He knows (or at least believes) he wants to end up at the top of a different hill than he is presently climbing. He can see that higher hill from where he stands.

> But the lure of the current hill is strong. There is a natural human tendency to make the next step an upward one. He ends up falling for a common trap [highlighted](http://books.google.com/books?id=znbkHaC8QeMC&lpg=PA256&ots=a_8QX_rduF&dq=thaler%20apple%20today&pg=PA256#v=onepage&q=thaler%20apple%20today&f=false) by behavioral economists: people tend to systematically overvalue near-term over long-term rewards. This effect seems to be even stronger in more ambitious people. Their ambition seems to make it hard for them to forgo the nearby upward step.

People early in their career should learn from computer science: meander some in your walk (especially early on), randomly drop yourself into new parts of the terrain, and when you find the highest hill, don’t waste any more time on the current hill no matter how much better the next step up might appear.

我认识一个聪明的年轻孩子，一年前从大学毕业，现在在一家大型投资银行工作。他已经决定他讨厌华尔街，想在一家科技创业公司工作（很好！）。他最近向他的老板们发出了通知，而老板们的反应是上演了一场说服他留下来的狗马戏。老板们告诉他，如果他留在银行，他将获得加薪和更大的责任。加入科技行业，他就会从头开始。他现在认为他会留下来，尽管他令人信服地宣布他在金融业没有长期的野心。

多年来，我遇到过许多处于类似情况的潜在雇员。当我问他们一个非常明显的问题。"10年后你想做什么？" 答案无一例外都是 "在科技创业公司工作或创办公司"--然而他们中的大多数人决定继续走他们现在的路，不加入创业公司。然后，几年后，他们终于辞去了工作，但只是在他们不喜欢的行业中呆了几年，而且没有真正推动他们实现长期的雄心壮志。

> 聪明的、有雄心壮志的人怎么能留在一个他们没有长期抱负的领域工作？我认为他们所犯的错误可以在计算机科学中找到一个很好的比喻。

计算机科学中的一个经典问题是[爬坡]（http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing）。想象一下，你被丢在一个丘陵地带的随机地点，由于雾气，你只能看到每个方向的几英尺。目标是到达最高的山头。

考虑一下最简单的算法。在任何给定的时刻，朝着能让你更高的方向迈出一步。这种方法的风险在于，如果你碰巧从较低的山丘附近开始，你最终会在那个较低的山丘的顶部，而不是最高的山丘的顶部。

这种算法的一个更复杂的版本在你的行走中加入了一些随机性。你开始时有很多随机性，随着时间的推移减少随机性的数量。这使你在开始集中的、非随机的攀登之前，有更好的机会在较大的山丘附近徘徊。

另一种通常更好的算法是让你反复把自己丢在地形的随机部分，做简单的爬山，然后在多次这样的尝试之后，回头决定哪座山是最高的。

回到求职者的问题上，他的好处是对自己的地形没有那么多的迷雾。他知道（或至少相信）他想在一个不同于他现在所爬的山顶上结束。他可以从他站的地方看到那个更高的山头。

> 但目前的山头的诱惑力很强。人类有一种自然的倾向，要使下一步成为向上的一步。他最终落入了行为经济学家的一个常见陷阱[强调](http://books.google.com/books?id=znbkHaC8QeMC&lpg=PA256&ots=a_8QX_rduF&dq=thaler%20apple%20today&pg=PA256#v=onepage&q=thaler%20apple%20today&f=false)：人们倾向于系统地高估近期的回报而不是长期的回报。这种影响似乎在更有野心的人身上更加强烈。他们的野心似乎使他们很难放弃附近的上升阶梯。

处于职业生涯早期的人应该从计算机科学中学习：在你的行走中蜿蜒一些（尤其是早期），随机地把自己丢到地形的新部分，当你找到最高的山丘时，不要在当前的山丘上浪费更多的时间，无论下一个台阶可能看起来有多棒。
