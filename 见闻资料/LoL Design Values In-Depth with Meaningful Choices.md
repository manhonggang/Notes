> Hey all,

> It's time for another entry in our ongoing series on the [**Design Values of League of Legends**](http://web.archive.org/web/20141007195214/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/dev-blog-design-values-league-legends)! Today we've got **Lead Champion Designer Andrei "Meddler" Van Roon**, here to talk about meaningful choices in League of Legends. This is a topic that goes fairly deep, so let's just let him get started!

## Why does meaningful choice matter?

To us, meaningful choices are one of the key things that allow a PvP game to have depth. The ability to make decisions that directly impact that state of the game is of absolute importance in driving satisfaction and [**mastery**](http://web.archive.org/web/20141007195214/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/lol-design-values-depth-mastery), and we always want to reward those make the best decisions.

Multiple attractive choices also allow for variety in experience, with games following many different paths. Meaningful choices (rather than single best choices) allow players to shape the state of the game based off their own preferences and what they feel they’re best at.

## What makes a choice meaningful?

Meaningful choices require that the player have sufficient understanding of the consequences of their decisions. Without knowing (or at least being able to predict) what's going to happen, a ‘choice’ of option basically becomes random. That’s not to say that the player needs to know every detail, or they need to see exactly how their decision will pan out - just enough to make an informed choice.

Significant difference between possible outcomes is also required. Clarity is nice, but if the choice is between a set of almost identical options – or if all choices result in the same, final outcome - there’s no significance to the choice in the first place.

It’s also important that the choices offered are actually accessible. If there are three possible choices of strategy but two can be executed by only the top 0.01% of players (reaction speed, required actions per second, etc) that effectively means there isn't a choice either.

Finally, for a choice to be meaningful there need to be situations where multiple options are potentially valid. If there’s always one obvious correct answer, it’s not a choice but a puzzle to be solved. Sometimes it's okay for there to be one right decision (see below), but games defined by questions that, once answered, stay answered forever (otherwise known as 'solved games') face the challenge of staying fresh (once again, if the focus is on meaningful PvP interactions).

## Why sometimes a lack of choice is OK

Meaningful choice adds a lot to a game, but it’s not an essential part of every element. Skillshots or challenging combos, for example, can be satisfying skill tests for many, even if the correct play is the same every time. Additionally – and this is particularly true in story driven genres – plot, setting or character development can often justify a lack of choice.

In League, a lack of meaningful choice is worth accepting either because of the benefits a single option brings to the rest of the game, or because the choice is meaningful to other players. For example, participating in the vision game is almost mandatory if you want to be a successful team, but vision control in League of Legends creates a lot of interesting play – particularly around contested objectives.

Sometimes it’s better to simply not offer a choice in the first place. For example, having a deep, unified competitive scene on Summoner's Rift - rather than a fragmented one split over multiple maps/modes - better supports our goals of making League of Legends a long-lasting, competitive game with deep potential for skill development. That’s not to say other maps or game modes don’t have interesting things to offer, but there are many benefits (and tradeoffs) for choosing to focus on one.

## Different ways to look at choice

There are many different ways to present a meaningful choice, and I'll run through a few examples:


#### **Single versus Constant**

Single choices often have a large impact on strategy and they commonly influence how future decisions in the game will be presented. This isn't to say that single choices have right or wrong answers, but five strategically mismatched choices against five strategically cohesive choices can be very tough.

*   Utility mid like Lulu or an assassin like Zed?

Constant choices, on the other hand, are ones that influence the game by inches – each time you make a conscious decision, it's just one step toward (or away from) victory.

*   Stay in lane and farm, go gank bot, try to steal the enemy’s blue buff?

  

#### **Always Available versus Windowed**

Choices that are always available are mostly related to mastery of efficiency. Knowing when to use something rarely wins a game single-handedly, but juggling the optimal timing of when to use many things is often what's needed to edge out a close victory.

*   Should I use my potion when I'm near full health so that I can optimize my jungle efficiency? Should I save it if I’m thinking about recalling soon?

Windowed choices are ones that are only available under certain circumstances and can therefore carry more weight than always available ones. It's like a form of efficiency, but also knowing what a windowed choice will lead to in the future.

*   While at the shop, do I spend my gold while I can, or do I save up for something I can’t afford yet? If I'm spending my gold, do I grab a Vamp Scepter or Boots and a Long Sword?

  

#### **Tactical versus Strategic**

Tactical choices are typically the ones that relate to pure combat mechanics and in-the-moment decision-making.

*   Which angle is Morgana going to fire Dark Binding at? Which way should I try and dodge, if at all?

Strategic choices, on the other hand, are ones that are focused on long-term decisions that dictate the pace and future opportunities within the game.

*   Do we try and fight them at Baron or do we let them have it while we go for an inhibitor?

  

***

While some of the above are direct examples of how we approach meaningful choices in League of Legends, I'd like to also look to the future before this entry gets too long.

## Looking forward / where we can do better

While providing meaningful choices is a core value that we design around, it's not something we've always delivered on well enough. As a result, there are a number of parts of the game we’re looking to make improvements to offer more interesting decision points. Have a few examples:

  

#### **Strategy**

We’d like League of Legends to have a broader range of possible options when it comes to how teams try to win a game. While this does rely heavily on champion diversity to influence strategy, we hope for there to be many ways to close out a game – through objective control, split pushing, straight teamfighting, getting strategic picks on solitary enemies, and beyond.

  

#### **Champions**

Some champions share too similar a niche with other champions, making the choice between them more a question of who's more powerful than what particular skillset you want on your team. We try to emphasize this distinction where possible – for example, both Trundle and Jax are fighters, but they are picked for a team for very different reasons (initiation, disengage, and strength against tanky targets versus ramping damage with strong offensive scaling combined with a high effectiveness against auto attackers).

In contrast, Mundo and Shyvana do share a bit too similar a niche, with both being tanky fighters that deal AoE damage over an extended period of time as they try to wear down a target via movement speed. That’s not to say they’re bad champions or that there aren’t differences between them (one is better at long skirmishes, the other has superior initiation), but we can certainly be offering a more interesting choice between the two. Trying to find distinct gameplay spaces for champions is one of the core things we’re focusing on with both new champions and champion updates.

  

#### **Items**

Some roles have a range of interesting itemization choices throughout the game. AP casters, for example get to make choices like Tear of the Goddess or Fiendish Codex early, and Zhonya’s or Deathcap later on. Other roles, however, have fewer interesting options available to them. Marksmen have generally followed very similar build paths to each other with low variance. As a result, we're trying to find ways to offer more distinct and appealing options, like the changes to Bloodthirster to better position it as a high end defensive AD item. In comparison, the old Bloodthirster - due to it having the highest AD in the game along with lifesteal - basically said, "Build this on every marksman that auto attacks or uses spells" (that is, all of them).

## And onward!

The above are just a few examples of where we think we can offer more meaningful choices for the future of League of Legends. Remember that this can go even more in-depth in systems like summoner spells, runes, masteries, or even lane positions on the map itself. Also, if you think there are unique opportunities where we can offer more depth or places where you think we've failed to offer sufficient choice, feel free to leave a comment below.

## 为什么有意义的选择很重要？

对我们来说，有意义的选择是让一款PvP游戏拥有深度的关键之一。能够做出直接影响该游戏状态的决定对推动满意度和掌握度是绝对重要的，我们总是希望奖励那些做出最佳决定的人。

多重有吸引力的选择也能让游戏体验多样化，游戏会遵循许多不同的路径。有意义的选择（而不是单一的最佳选择）让玩家可以根据自己的喜好和自己觉得最擅长的事情来塑造游戏的状态。

## 是什么让一个选择变得有意义？

有意义的选择需要玩家对自己的决定的后果有足够的了解。如果不知道（或者至少能够预测）会发生什么，那么一个 "选择 "的选项基本上就变成了随机的。这并不是说玩家需要知道每一个细节，或者他们需要看到他们的决定到底会如何发展--只要足够做出明智的选择。

可能结果之间的显著差异也是需要的。明确性是好的，但如果选择是在一组几乎相同的选项之间--或者如果所有选择的结果都是相同的、最终的结果--那么首先就没有选择的意义。

同样重要的是，所提供的选择实际上是可以获得的。如果有三个可能的策略选择，但有两个只有最顶尖的0.01%的玩家可以执行（反应速度、每秒所需动作等），那实际上意味着也没有选择。

最后，为了使选择有意义，需要有多种选择可能有效的情况。如果总是有一个明显的正确答案，那就不是一个选择，而是一个待解的难题。有时候，只有一个正确的决定是可以的（见下文），但是由问题定义的游戏，一旦回答了，就会永远保持答案（也就是所谓的 "已解决的游戏"）面临着保持新鲜感的挑战（再一次，如果重点是有意义的PvP互动的话）。

## 为什么有时候缺乏选择也没关系

有意义的选择为游戏增添了不少乐趣，但并不是每个元素都必不可少。例如，技能射击或具有挑战性的连击，对许多人来说可以是令人满意的技能测试，即使每次的正确玩法都是一样的。此外--在故事驱动的类型中尤其如此--剧情、背景或角色发展往往可以证明缺乏选择的合理性。

在《联盟》中，缺乏有意义的选择是值得接受的，要么是因为单个选项给游戏的其他部分带来了好处，要么是因为这个选择对其他玩家有意义。例如，如果你想成为一个成功的团队，参与视野游戏几乎是强制性的，但英雄联盟中的视野控制创造了很多有趣的玩法--特别是围绕有争议的目标。

有时候，干脆一开始就不提供选择更好。例如，在召唤师裂缝上拥有一个深度的、统一的竞技场景--而不是分割在多个地图/模式上的零散场景--更好地支持了我们的目标，即让《英雄联盟》成为一个持久的、具有深度技能发展潜力的竞技游戏。这并不是说其他地图或游戏模式没有有趣的东西可以提供，但选择专注于一个地图有很多好处（和权衡）。

## 不同的方式来看待选择

有很多不同的方式来呈现一个有意义的选择，我将通过几个例子来说明。

#### 单一与恒定
单项选择往往对策略有很大的影响，它们通常会影响游戏中未来的决策如何呈现。这并不是说单选有对错的答案，但五个战略上不匹配的选择对上五个战略上有凝聚力的选择是非常艰难的。

- 像璐璐这样的实用型中单还是像泽德这样的刺客？

另一方面，恒定的选择是那些影响游戏的寸步不离的选择--每次你做出有意识的决定，都只是向（或远离）胜利迈出了一步。

- 留在队列里种田，去gank bot，尝试偷取敌方的蓝buff？

#### 永远可用与窗口化

时刻都可以使用的选择多半与效率的掌握有关。知道什么时候使用什么东西很少能单枪匹马地赢得比赛，但要想险胜，往往需要耍好很多东西的最佳使用时机。

- 我应该在接近满健康的时候使用我的药水，这样才能优化我的丛林效率？如果我考虑很快就要召回，我是否应该保存它？

窗口化的选择是指只有在某些情况下才能使用的选择，因此可以比总是可用的选择更有分量。这就像是一种效率，但也知道窗口化选择在未来会导致什么。

在商店的时候，我是趁早花掉我的金子，还是攒钱买一些我还买不起的东西？如果我在花金子，我是抢一个吸血鬼权杖还是靴子和长剑？

#### 战术与战略

战术选择通常是指那些与纯战斗机制和当下决策有关的选择。

- 莫甘娜会从哪个角度发射黑暗束缚？我应该尝试从哪个角度躲避？

而战略选择则是注重长期的决策，决定着游戏内的节奏和未来的机会。

- 我们是在男爵处尝试和他们战斗，还是让他们得逞，而我们去找抑制剂？

虽然以上一些是我们在《英雄联盟》中如何对待有意义的选择的直接例子，但我还想在这篇报道变得太长之前展望一下未来。

## 展望未来/我们可以做得更好的地方

虽然提供有意义的选择是我们设计的核心价值，但我们一直以来都没有很好地实现这个价值。因此，我们正在寻求对游戏的一些部分进行改进，以提供更有趣的决策点。有几个例子。

#### 战略

我们希望《英雄联盟》在团队如何尝试赢得比赛时，能有更多可能的选择。虽然这在很大程度上依赖于冠军的多样性来影响策略，但我们希望能有多种方式来结束比赛--通过目标控制、分推、直接团队作战、对单个敌人进行策略选取等等。

#### 冠军

有些冠军与其他冠军有着太过相似的定位，这使得在他们之间的选择更多的是谁更强大的问题，而不是你想在你的团队中使用哪种特定的技能组合。我们尽可能地强调这种区别--例如，特伦德尔和贾克斯都是战士，但他们被选入队伍的原因却截然不同（发动、脱离、对坦克型目标的强度与对自动攻击者的强攻缩减与高效力的斜坡伤害）。

相比之下，蒙多和希瓦娜的定位确实有点太相似了，他们都是在长时间内造成AoE伤害的坦克战士，因为他们试图通过移动速度来消磨目标。这并不是说他们是糟糕的冠军，也不是说他们之间没有差异（一个更擅长长时间的小规模战斗，另一个有更出色的启动），但我们肯定可以在两者之间提供更有趣的选择。试图为冠军找到独特的游戏空间是我们在新冠军和冠军更新中关注的核心事情之一。

#### 项目

有些角色在整个游戏中会有一系列有趣的物品选择。例如AP施法者在早期就可以做出女神之泪或恶魔法典这样的选择，而后期则可以选择Zhonya的或死亡之帽。而其他角色则少了一些有趣的选择。神枪手之间一般都遵循着非常相似的构建路径，差异性很低。因此，我们正在努力寻找方法提供更多独特和吸引人的选择，比如对嗜血者的改动，以更好地将其定位为高端防御性AD物品。相比之下，旧的Bloodthirster--由于它拥有游戏中最高的AD以及生命值--基本上说，"把这个建在每一个自动攻击或使用法术的神射手身上"(也就是说，所有的人)。

## 然后继续前进!

以上只是我们认为可以为《英雄联盟》的未来提供更有意义的选择的几个例子。请记住，这可以在召唤师法术、符文、精通、甚至是地图本身的道位等系统中更加深入。另外，如果你认为有独特的机会，我们可以提供更多的深度，或者你认为我们未能提供足够选择的地方，欢迎在下方留言。
