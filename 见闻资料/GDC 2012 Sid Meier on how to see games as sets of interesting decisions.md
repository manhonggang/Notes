“Games are a series of interesting decisions,” says Firaxis’ Sid Meier. It’s a statement he’s made in the past �" and he’s noticed (by Googling himself) that viewpoint of his has been a source of some debate. But it’s one of his favorite ways of thinking about game design, so in his packed GDC 2012 lecture, he explained the idea in depth �" what makes decisions in gameplay interesting for players, and what do designers need to know?

“It’s easier to look at it as what is _not_ an interesting decision,” says the legendary creator of _Civilization_. If a player always chooses the first from among a set of three choices, it’s probably not an interesting choice; nor is a random selection. While there are some types of games where the idea of interesting decisions isn’t the best way to look at things �" say rhythm games or puzzle games based on different sorts of inputs -- he generally believes the idea is a helpful way to look at the medium.

“It’s a useful concept during the design phase. One of the things I see often is that designs are kind of about putting together pieces of other games,” says Meier. There’s the idea that if some games are fun, then combinations of their elements will also be fun.

“Unfortunately, that doesn’t always work out,” he says. “And I think it’s a more useful way to look at a new game design in terms of, what are the decisions I’m presenting the player, and are they interesting?... Put yourself in the player’s chair.”

**What Makes An Interesting Decision?**  

One common characteristic of interesting decisions is that they involve some kind of tradeoff �" say, the opportunity to get a big sword costs 500 gold, or in a racing game the fastest car may have poorer handling. In Meier’s _Civilization_, the act of building a defensive unit has complex resource costs in exchange for protection.

“Good decisions are situational. There’s a very key idea that when the decision is presented to the player, ideally it acts in an interesting way with the game situation,” Meier explains. _Civ_ contains complex systems that provide a number of situational choices, where the options presented to players and the factors therein depend heavily on what’s happening in the game world.

Some of these decisions are personal and tied to the player’s gaming style. A cautious player would choose to build a very secure base from which to expand; an aggressive player invests in its offensive units. “This interesting decision would allow you to express your personal play style,” he says.

Interesting decisions are persistent and affect the game for a certain amount of time, as long as the player has enough information to make the decision �" when early choices can ruin the game experience down the road, developers need to present them in a fashion appropriate to that. “

One classic decision type is a risk-versus-reward scenario that asks the player to weigh potential penalties against the possibilities of rewards. “In almost any kind of game you’ll find opportunities for these decisions,” he says. Another decision category is short versus long-term decisions �" like building a wonder in _Civilization_, which takes a long time but has a significant long-term impact �" versus building a chariot, which is finished much more quickly but has much less effect on the overall landscape of the game.

When it comes to accommodating the player’s play style, “it’s very tempting as a designer to imagine that everybody plays a game the same way that you do, and it’s very tempting as a design and development group to feel that you represent all players,” he says. That’s why he finds it essential to good design to allow for as many choices and play styles as possible.

One of the strengths of _Civilization_ in Meier’s own view, is that it has things happening on multiple levels at once in terms of short-, medium- and long-term events. The player’s task is to prioritize and to manage strategies for both near-term and long-term goals, and evolve the short-term goals to make the long-term goal more accessible.

Customization functions also create interesting decisions, even if it’s as simple as choosing a name for your city or a color for your vehicle. “It makes \[the player\] more connected to the game that they’re playing,” Meier says. “Think about ways of investing the player in your game by inviting them to make decisions that let them to express their personality or their gaming style.

**Informed Choices**

Key to making decision meaningful is to ensure players understand the full scope of their choices; it’s not fun for the player to be in a situation where they have to pick something, and then marinate in that gnawing feeling of wondering what might happen as a result of their choice or how severe the impact might be. “It’s almost worth erring on the side of providing the player with too much information, or at least enough that they’re comfortable with understanding the choices,” Meier advises.

When it comes to making players comfortable and happy as they make decisions, genre conventions help �" the fact that most shooters have something of a standard interface help players feel assured. When a player presses a button that in every other game in its genre does a certain thing and receives an unfamiliar result, “there’s nothing more disconcerting,” he warns.

One reason that many of Firaxis’ games involve historical topics is that the player can come to the experience with a lot of information that they already know. “It’s important to reinforce that information for the player �" if you run into Genghis Khan in a _Civilization_ game, you’re going to expect him to be kinda angry and aggressive… if you’re building a game about railroads or pirates, there’s a lot that the player can bring to a topic like that that they already know.”

Zombies are popular because they’re very clear �" their motivation is basic and their nature is obvious and well understood. “It’s an example of a decision where you don’t have to add a lot of information for the player; they pretty much know what to do.”

On the other hand, once the player makes a decision the response from the game is enormously important: “The worst thing you can do is just move on. There’s nothing more paranoia-inducing than having made a decision and the game just kind of goes on. At least have a sound effect that says, ‘I’ve heard what you said and I’m going to do it.’” In _Civilization Revolution_, players were so pleased to get feedback on some of their unit moves when they negotiated with leaders from other areas, for example.

Feedback helps players feel responsible and meaningful within the game world. “It’s really important to let the player know that you know that they’re there, that you’re a partner with them, that you’re right there next to them all the way,” Meier explains. “That yes, ‘you are the leader of a great civilization’, or ‘you are a great race car driver’. Whether it’s a sound or text, a visual or graphic… really reinforce the fantasy the player is creating in their mind and really allow them to enjoy that.”

**The Player Types**

In order to create lots of interesting decisions for players, it’s important for designers to understand the many types of players there are. There’s the player that cares mainly about winning, who can offer feedback on tuning the game’s higher levels. There’s the genre fan, who is a fan of the specific genre and loves anything that resembles things they love already �" and resents deviations. This player’s feedback is useful for understanding how to use the genre conventions, but hopefully doesn’t constrain new developments.

There’s the player the one who wants to understand all of the game’s algorithm and calculate the best possible scenarios. This player can help with game balance �" within reason, as the player really just wants to unravel and own the systems. Then, there’s the paranoid player, who feels that everything is stacked against him or her, assuming that dice rolls are rigged or unfair. The history buff will criticize elements of the setting and complain about loyalty to source material or accuracy of a historical setting.

The player who Meier calls “Mr. Bubble Boy” is the one who dwells on the one unfortunate game experience he or she had. “You need to prevent setbacks in a very sensitive way, where the player understands why it’s happening and what they can do next time… one incident colors their entire experience.” And there’ll always be that armchair designer who focuses on every detail of why a given game isn’t like the one he or she creates.

It’s useful to understand all of these player types and to benefit from their feedback, but all of them can cause consequences if their views are too highly prized.

**More Interesting Decisions**

Once a game implements interesting decisions, what makes them more interesting? A strong balance of risk-reward choices; adjusting how impactful choices are, giving the player more or less information, providing time frame within which to make decisions, or adjusting how many choices there are in the game can all completely define and refine a design. There’s a flavor slider, too: “This is really a presentation issue,” he says. “Take advantage of those artists, those writers that are working on your game to really add flavor.”

“Be careful to manage that balance,” he says. “If you’re playing a game with complicated decisions that come at you one after the other the player is going to feel out of control. On the other hand, if you give your player some very simple decisions at a very slow place, they’re kind of bored.”

The last way to make a game more interesting through decisions? Get rid of ones that are not working. “You’ve tried all these things and they don’t work. Maybe the decision is just one you should take out of your game.,” says Meier. “Be ruthless in terms of cutting things out… probably a third of the things that we try, if not more, end up getting taken out of the game because they’re not fun and interesting enough.”

“You don’t want to forget that your game is more than just decisions,” he emphasizes. The detailed minutiae of developing interesting decisions ought not to take away from the production of a rich, vivid world that feels real and fun for the player. A strong fantasy environment coupled with empowering and interesting decisions is a key coupling that creates a long-term relationship between a player and a game, he believes.

“It’s the combination of this wonderful fantasy world that you create and the interesting decisions that the player gets to make in that world that really is the sum total of the quality of your game,” Meier concludes.

"游戏是一系列有趣的决定，"Firaxis的Sid Meier说。这是他在过去说过的一句话。"而且他也注意到（通过谷歌搜索）他的这一观点一直在引起一些争论。但这是他最喜欢的游戏设计思考方式之一，所以在他的GDC 2012演讲中，他深入解释了这个观点。"是什么让游戏中的决策对玩家来说很有趣，以及设计师需要知道什么？

"把它看成什么是不有趣的决定更容易。"这位《文明》的传奇创作者说。如果一个玩家总是从一组三个选择中选择第一个，那可能不是一个有趣的选择；随机选择也不是。虽然在某些类型的游戏中，有趣决定的想法并不是最好的方式。"比如说节奏游戏或基于不同类型输入的益智游戏--他普遍认为这个想法是一种看待媒介的有益方式。

"在设计阶段，这是一个有用的概念。我经常看到的一件事是，设计是一种关于将其他游戏的碎片放在一起的设计，"Meier说。有这样的想法，如果一些游戏很有趣，那么它们的元素组合也会很有趣。

"不幸的是，这并不总是成功的，"他说。"而我认为这是一种更有用的方式，从一个新的游戏设计来看，我给玩家呈现的决定是什么，它们是否有趣? 把自己放在玩家的椅子上。"

什么才是有趣的决定？

有趣的决定有一个共同的特点，那就是它们涉及到某种权衡。"比如说，获得一把大剑的机会需要花费500金，或者在赛车游戏中，最快的车可能有更差的操控性。在梅尔的《文明》中，建造一个防御单位的行为有复杂的资源成本来换取保护。

"好的决策是因地制宜的。有一个非常关键的想法，当决策呈现给玩家时，理想情况下，它与游戏情境以一种有趣的方式行动。"Meier解释说。Civ》包含了复杂的系统，提供了许多情境选择，其中呈现给玩家的选项和其中的因素很大程度上取决于游戏世界中发生的事情。

其中一些决定是个人的，与玩家的游戏风格息息相关。一个谨慎的玩家会选择建立一个非常安全的基地，并在此基础上进行扩张；一个激进的玩家则会投资其进攻性单位。"这个有趣的决定会让你表达你个人的游戏风格。"他说。

有趣的决定是持久的，并且会在一定时间内影响游戏，只要玩家有足够的信息来做决定。"当早期的选择会毁掉以后的游戏体验时，开发者需要以一种适合的方式来呈现。“

一个经典的决策类型是风险与回报的方案，要求玩家权衡潜在的惩罚与回报的可能性。"几乎在任何一种游戏中，你都能找到这些决策的机会，"他说。另一个决策类别是短期与长期的决策。"就像在《文明》中建造一个奇迹，它需要花费很长的时间，但却会产生重大的长期影响。"而建造一辆战车，它的完成速度要快得多，但对游戏整体格局的影响却小得多。

当谈到容纳玩家的游戏风格时，"作为一个设计师，很容易想象每个人都和你以同样的方式玩一款游戏，而作为一个设计和开发小组，很容易觉得你代表了所有的玩家，"他说。这就是为什么他认为好的设计必须允许尽可能多的选择和游戏风格。

在Meier自己看来，《文明》的优势之一，就是它的短期、中期和长期事件在多个层面上同时发生。玩家的任务是确定优先级，并对近期和长期目标的策略进行管理，并对短期目标进行进化，使长期目标更容易实现。

自定义功能也创造了有趣的决定，即使是为你的城市选择一个名字或为你的车辆选择一种颜色这么简单。"它使[玩家]与他们正在玩的游戏更有联系，"Meier说。"考虑如何通过邀请玩家做出决定，让他们表达他们的个性或他们的游戏风格来投资你的游戏。

知情的选择

让决定变得有意义的关键是确保玩家了解他们选择的全部范围；对于玩家来说，如果他们不得不选择一些东西，然后腌制在那种令人头疼的感觉中，想知道他们的选择可能会发生什么，或者影响可能会有多严重，那就不好玩了。"几乎值得错误地提供给玩家太多的信息，或者至少让他们对理解选择感到舒适，"Meier建议。

当谈到让玩家在做决定时感到舒适和快乐时，流派惯例会有帮助。"事实上，大多数射击游戏都有一些标准的界面帮助玩家感到放心。当玩家按下一个在其他游戏中都会做的按钮，却得到一个不熟悉的结果时，"没有比这更让人不安的了"，他警告说。

Firaxis的很多游戏都涉及历史题材，原因之一是玩家可以带着很多已经知道的信息来体验。"为玩家强化这些信息是很重要的。"如果你在一款文明游戏中遇到成吉思汗，你会期待他是挺愤怒和有攻击性的......如果你正在打造一款关于铁路或海盗的游戏，那么玩家可以带着很多他们已经知道的话题来体验。"

植物大战僵尸之所以受欢迎，是因为它们非常清晰。"它们的动机是基本的，它们的本质是明显的，很好理解。"这是一个决定的例子，你不需要为玩家添加很多信息，他们几乎知道该怎么做。"

另一方面，一旦玩家做出了决定，游戏的反应就非常重要："你能做的最坏的事情就是继续前进。没有什么比做出决定后，游戏就这样继续下去更让人偏执的了。至少要有一个声音效果说：'我听到你说的话了，我要去做'。" 在《文明大革命》中，玩家在与其他地区的领导人谈判时，比如说他们的一些单位行动能得到反馈，玩家非常高兴。

反馈有助于玩家感到自己在游戏世界中的责任和意义。"让玩家知道你知道他们在那里，你是他们的伙伴，你就在他们身边一直陪伴着他们，这真的很重要，"Meier解释道。"那是的，'你是一个伟大文明的领袖'，或者'你是一个伟大的赛车手'。无论是声音还是文字，视觉还是图形......都能真正强化玩家在脑海中创造的幻想，并真正让他们享受到这种感觉。"

玩家类型

为了给玩家创造很多有趣的决策，设计师必须了解有很多类型的玩家。有主要关心胜利的玩家，他们可以对调整游戏的更高等级提供反馈。还有一种是流派迷，他们是特定流派的粉丝，喜欢任何与他们已经喜欢的东西相似的东西。这个玩家的反馈对于理解如何使用流派惯例很有帮助，但希望不会制约新的发展。

还有一种玩家是想了解游戏的所有算法，并计算出最好的方案。这个玩家可以在合理的范围内帮助游戏平衡。"因为这个玩家真的只是想解开和拥有系统。然后，还有一种偏执狂玩家，他们觉得一切都对自己不利，认为掷骰子是被操纵或不公平的。历史爱好者会批评设定的元素，抱怨对原始资料的忠诚或历史设定的准确性。

而被Meier称为 "泡沫男孩先生 "的玩家，则会纠结于自己的一次不幸的游戏经历。"你需要用一种非常敏感的方式来防止挫折，让玩家明白为什么会发生这样的事情，以及他们下次能做什么......一次事件会影响他们的整个体验。" 而总有那个扶手椅上的设计师会关注每一个细节，为什么某个游戏和他或她创造的游戏不一样。

理解所有这些类型的玩家并从他们的反馈中获益是很有用的，但如果他们的观点被过于看重，都会造成后果。

更多有趣的决定

一旦游戏实现了有趣的决策，是什么让它们变得更有趣？强烈的风险-回报选择的平衡；调整选择的影响程度，给玩家更多或更少的信息，提供做出决定的时间框架，或者调整游戏中的选择数量，都可以完全定义和完善一个设计。还有一个味道滑块。他说："这其实是一个表现的问题"。"利用那些艺术家、作家的优势，让他们在你的游戏中真正增加风味。"

"要小心管理这种平衡，"他说。"如果你玩的游戏有复杂的决定，这些决定一个接一个地向你袭来，玩家就会觉得失去控制。另一方面，如果你在一个很慢的地方给玩家一些很简单的决定，他们就会有点无聊。"

最后一个通过决策让游戏变得更有趣的方法是什么？摆脱那些没有用的东西。"你已经试过了所有这些东西，但它们并不奏效。也许这个决定只是一个你应该从游戏中拿出来的决定。"梅尔说。"在砍掉东西方面要狠下心来......可能我们尝试的三分之一的东西，甚至更多，最后都会被从游戏中拿出来，因为它们不够好玩和有趣。"

"你不要忘记，你的游戏不仅仅是决定，"他强调。开发有趣决策的细节琐事不应该影响到制作一个丰富生动的世界，让玩家感觉到真实和有趣。他认为，一个强大的幻想环境加上赋能和有趣的决策，是在玩家和游戏之间建立长期关系的关键耦合。

"你所创造的这个美妙的幻想世界和玩家在这个世界中做出的有趣决定的结合，才是真正意义上的游戏质量的总和。"Meier总结道。
